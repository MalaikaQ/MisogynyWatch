OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:

 > I told my MIL at a family gathering that she wasnt the one who recommended my daughter's name, it was my favorite name from the start. It may not have been the time and place to correct her in front of everyone, and caused bitterness which I could've avoided.

Honestly, the fact that your MIL ever gave anyone the idea that it came from her is evidence enough that it needed to be corrected immediately.

Youu are NTA, it is your mother-in-law and your husband who are the a\*\*\*\*\*\* here. Yes I said your husband, because he must have already known this, there's no way SIL refers to it as MIL's doing without your husband knowing about this. at least hearing about it.

Do it! iIts not like you disagreed with her or she's wrong so WTF with you not backing her up all to appease your mother?

I'm sure your wife doesn't want to hear this story for the rest of her goddamn life, when it's not even true, so get your balls out of your mom's purse, and attach them to your marriage instead, and remind your mom gently when it is yours to do that, like EVERY TIME.

You don't have your wife's back, You're trying to make her less to make your mom bigger? Why hat kind of crappy partnering is that?

You're allowing your mother to rewrite your own personal family's narrative, and your wife is rightfully angry at this -because it's a lie! Get in line with the truth, and protect your own nuclear family, not your mother's ego and the status quo. If you have to shake things up, too f\*\*\*\*\*\* bad- do it.

She told me it would be her tradition for both my brother's kids and mine. My MIL said it was her ""gift"" to us to buy our child's entire wardrobe for the first (I don't remember how many) years, because it was something she had done for my BIL's family too, so its tradition. I noped on both these ""traditions."" Hard pass. No thanks. My husband told his mom that she was welcome to buy the x years supply of diapers, but he and I already bought much of baby's wardrobe. Funny... we didn't get years of clothes *or* diapers! I advised my mom that she was welcome to send whatever holiday outfits she wished but it might be more useful to send holiday themed regular clothes kiddo could wear all December or spring because we don't do dress up Christian holidays, Santa photos, or Easter Bunny photos (since my husband is Buddhist.)

His mom has no right to be angry. She should be embarrassed. Your husband should tell her that she would have no reason to be upset if she didn't lie in the first place.

 Blaming you for telling the truth is ridiculous and your husband coddling her and allowing her (and even agreeing with her!) to shift blame to you is a major problem.",3,2025-08-12 23:02:10,False,"AITA for correcting my MIL at a family gathering that she didn't recommend my daughter's name, it was my favorite name?",605,2025-08-12 20:21:38,125,,,,,,[]

I've been married to my husband for almost two years and our daughter is 11 months old. When we found out we were having a girl, one of the names that was immediately top contender was the name of a character I really like in a very popular book/movie franchise. My husband is a huge fan of the franchise too and with time that name just became the only one that I wanted and we landed on it and then told our parents about it. I remember my MIL questioning whether phonetically there would be an alternative spelling that could cause confusion, and I had said no it wouldn't and had explained to her the subtle difference in pronunciation and it was a whole conversation I'd had with her.

Last weekend we were at my in-laws place for a dinner, my BIL and SIL were there too. So we were watching my daughter cruising along the room, using the couches as support and looking at us to see if we were looking and then laughing. My BIL's wife had remarked how radiant she looked and how she'd really taken to her name literally. My SIL then said that it was a really good choice by my MIL.

I was confused I asked what she's talking about and my SIL said that my MIL had been the one to recommend the name right? My MIL then said yeah that she'd said its a good name. I was literally stunned for a second and then made it clear that I'd come up with the name, how I'd known of it, and that my husband also knew of that character, and that we were dead set on the name, there were no recommendations to be had. I asked my husband to corroborate the story which he did, uncomfortably. My MIL said names are a collective family effort, and everyone pitched in, but I still said this name was one that was very dear to me and it was one I'd come up with. (Maybe I shouldn't have pushed on that a second time? That's why I'm here.)

When we came home and were in bed, my husband had been getting texts from his mom and sister. He said I was right in my account of what had happened but he also told me I'd been tactless, that we know it was my name, and our daughter has a beautiful name that suits her, why make it into something that causes bitterness. And today he had a phonecall with his mom, just a regular one. I asked if she was still pissed, he said she was. He said that he understood why I did it but it wasn't the time and place. Was I TA?

The action might make me the asshole as my cousin told me that I unnecessarily embarrassed her. She said I broke the girl code.

Borderline gaslighting by making up a girl code to convince you to overlook her obvious insult.

If that's who she is, so be it. She's your friend and will likely never change and if that's who she's always been then you should be used to the drama.

However, if that's new, good you corrected it quickly.

I had a GF once who was a liar, cheater, and all-around ... fun person to be around. Unhinged. Perhaps the poster child for ""don't ... crazy"". The only saving grace? She NEVER used those tools against me (when I was her BF and after we broke up) or any close friends. Only random acquaintances. If she's willing to do that you YOU, ask her if you're actually friends. 

""Seriously: You literally tried to embarrass me. On purpose. No accident. I thought we were friends? Then trying to cover it up with some made up 'girl-code', I'm not sure I know who you are."" Might be a bit deep, but if she's having relationship issues, that may pry them lose while also letting her know where that line is and reminding her of who her friends are.

I'm (18f) from Ontario Canada and my cousin (19f) is from Florida USA. I'm staying with her family in Florida. We were out at midday at an outdoor restaurant and my cousin's boyfriend (20m) was to meet us. My cousin had a sweaty body odor but she had an active day.
        The BF kissed me cousin, and she introduced us. At the table, he made a face. When I was looking away, my cousin tried to whisper to her BF but I heard her. ""The smell is from (my name). Please don't say anything."" I said the smell is not from me. The BF got his nose close to my cousin upper body and smelled her. He kissed her on top of her head and told her it's humanizing when such a beautiful woman gets smelly. She laughed awkwardly. 
           On the ride back home, she told me that I unnecessarily embarrassed her. She said I broke the girl code. Am I the asshole ?

This is seriously the best possible response from the boyfriend because it acknowledges that it's a human experience and it doesn't negatively effect his opinion of her.

There was this one time where I got really drunk and took two laxatives thinking that they were ibuprofen. 

I tried to blame the dog for the resulting chaos, but was stymied by the fact that I did not actually have a dog. 

But I also didn't have a partner/bed-mate at the time, making the entire (fake) excuse superfluous. 

In conclusion, I was probably still quite drunk, and there wasn't actually any poop. I didn't even have any laxatives in the house in the first place and it turns out that I had taken 500mg of tangerine-flavored Tic-Tacs.

I (27F) I’m getting married to my fiancé (26M)who I have been with for the last six years. Our wedding date is very soon and last month I asked for all RSVPs to please let me know who they were all bringing to the wedding my brother (23M) did not respond to this so I texted him to find out who he was bringing. He acted very nonchalant and he said oh It’s just Carrie (25F). Now me and Carrie have a very long history, but I will sum it up to the fact that she was my high school bully. I told him I’m sorry, but she will not be allowed to attend my wedding and I stated that she bullied me throughout high school saying things about me behind my back to several different people to the point where I only talk to two people my entire senior year because of her. Just a week prior to this conversation that I had with my brother, I was talking with some of my friends who still live in our hometown. And one of my friends let’s call her Chelsea (29F). Told me a story about how Carrie had tried to get Chelsea‘s boyfriend to cheat on her  with Carrie. I did tell my brother the story I was told from Chelsea about Carrie that happened three weeks before that conversation. My brother then stated that he would not be coming to my wedding if he could not bring Carrie with him. I said I’m sorry, but I will not have my high school bully attend my wedding.   It’s your choice to not come, but we would be holding a spot for him at the ceremony and reception if he decided last minute that he was going to attend. I also stated that if you would like to bring anyone else he’s more than welcome to, that she is the one person that I refuse to have on my wedding. I told my mother that my brother had decided that he would not be coming to my wedding and she cried and tried to get me to change my mind to allow her to come, but I just know having her in attendance I’d be super self-conscious about everything going on and more worried that she’s gonna be talking shit about me behind my back to my family. So Reddit, am I the asshole for telling my brother that he cannot bring his plus one to my wedding?

Those 1500 followers are interested in your son *because* of his suggestive pictures. Him deleting the pictures doesn't change the situation. It doesn't matter that he invested time into getting their attention. He does not need their attention. 

However, you should be taking it a step further and looking into getting your son therapy to get to the bottom of why he has such a strong need for attention that he'd be entertaining dangerous relationships online with people who want to sexualize your child. Moreso, inviting the attentions of possibly anti-trans individuals while presenting himself as a femboy. Not to victim blame here, but he's building a powder keg around himself of people who want to be abusive towards him and he could get seriously hurt if one of his followers decides to light the fuse.",306,2025-08-12 23:05:17,False,AITA?

Otherwise it could lead him to doing it more but hiding it better from you. Going further down severe conservative/right-wing pipelines. The key is teach proper moral education and communication in this case, be careful not to invoke punishment without explanation. You need to ask what his intentions are, what he got out of doing it, he needs to know that its understandable he has gone to these outlets but they arent healthy or safe for him.

n8fa56t,1mow1hi,AmItheAsshole,Scrounger888,"NTA. That number of followers is not a good thing for an underage child to have, especially one who is posing provocatively. He may thing he's mature because people are messaging him, but he is too naive yet to understand the sheer inappropriateness of him doing that. Depending on laws in your country, and what the poses contain, it may fall under child [explicit images]. Those 1500 followers are NOT something you should be worried about him losing because the vast majority of them would be creepers and pervs. If he met up with one of those creeps, many negative things could happen to him. He could already be the target of grooming. Whether he's gay, bi or straight, someone of his age shouldn't be publicly posting that sort of thing. What's on the internet never truly disappears. 


He probably won't want to talk about this with his parents, but therapy would possibly be beneficial, to get to the bottom of his desire to post pictures for attention like that, and to get him to understand why that behavior is risky. It will also help him unravel why he's making derogatory speeches about people who dress or act like him as it hints at a deep-seated disgust at part of himself. Getting likes and attention from others might be how he gets his reassurance and that's not a healthy place to seek validation from.",48,2025-08-12 23:19:50,False,AITA?

Around 2 weeks ago I was getting food with my 2 sons and husband. I glanced over at one of my sons phones for a split second a notification of a very sexual message he received on Twitter. He’s only 16 so I was worried about his safety. When we were alone later I told him to give me his phone so I could check his Twitter dms but when I opened his account I saw that he had over 1,500 followers and was posting images of himself in suggestive poses while dressed as a girl and spouting conservative rhetoric, mostly about transgender people which I found very odd considering what he was doing. I always had a suspicion that he was gay but the conservative stuff is what caught me off guard. I told him that he’s too young to have an account like this and made him delete it and that he should try to be more open-minded towards the groups of people he hated on. Since then he has barely talked to me and now I’m starting to think that I went too far making him delete the entire account. I know it took a long time to get that many followers so maybe I should’ve just made him delete the suggestive photos and not post any more of them

You were correct to make him delete his account, that’s not why you are the asshole. But you were less correct to make the deletion about the conservative aspect. If he was saying hateful things about transgendered individuals, that does need addressing, yes. But the primary concern here is AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE your son’s safety and mental health. You should currently be more concerned with ensuring none of those 1500 probably angry, adult male followers have any personal information of his. And ensuring he has a therapist or safe place to understand why he felt the need to post content like that in the first place, and deal with his mental and emotional health or internal identity struggles, in healthy ways that aren’t harmful to other people.",-27,2025-08-12 23:15:15,False,AITA?

n8f7hyg,1mow1hi,AmItheAsshole,ApprehensiveBook4214,"YTA because I think you should have had a conversation about this first. I get where you're coming from.  I just think this was handled in a bit of a heavy handed manner rather than something thought out and understood by him. 


Also as far as I know on X (formerly Twitter) you deactivate your account and have 30 days to log back in to reactivate it.  After the 30 days it's permanently deleted. So there's still a chance you can talk about this, reactivate the account, and have him delete the suggestive photos. 


Edit:  apparently clarification is needed.  My verdict is based on why OP thinks she might be TA (1 - I made my son delete his 1,500 follower Twitter account. 2 - He spent a long time getting that many followers) not the content the son was creating.  


I say she's TA because as it is I don't think he gets the problem with what he was doing.  So he could simply create a new account, create the same type of content, and hide it better.  Or wait 2 years until he's an adult.  At 16 he's old enough to have discussions about this which is part of preparing him for adulthood. Not discussing this with him makes OP TA. Simply deleting the account and telling him to be more open-minded is unlikely to actually address the issues with what he was doing.",-154,2025-08-12 22:55:15,False,AITA?

She just stands there and bellows for you? 

Anyway, you have asked and it didn’t go well, so the next step is *making her habit non beneficial*.  De-link the action from the response. 

If she yells, don’t appear.  Her yelling is now ineffective. 

Hopefully she tries an alternative strategy (like getting up to find you) rather than bellowing for you.

Being out of toilet paper or on a ladder are just a couple of circumstances where hollering for help is acceptable.  And the toilet paper should be refilled by whoever used the last roll but I can see how that can slip people’s minds.  I can even understand it if she’s sick in bed with the flu or something.

Hollering at you to just help her with mundane tasks sounds over the top.  She’s hollering at you, especially in front of others, as a way to get attention and to show off how she “has you wrapped around her little finger”.  Stop responding to her.  She’s gonna eventually stop hollering and come get you.  Yeah, she’ll demand to know why you didn’t respond to her the first fifty times she called you.

Whenever my wife wants something of me, she just screams my name and waits for me to appear. It particularly irritates me when she does it around her friends. 

When none of her friends were around, I asked her to please stop doing that... and that it came off disrespectful to me. Instead, i asked that she just come to me and tell me what she needs help with... 9.9/10 times ill do whatever i can to help out. 

She got extremely upset and made it seem like everything she does comes off as if she is bothering me.... that it's so dumb for her to come find me and then us walk back to whatever it is together....

OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:

 > (1) If I were to go through with what I'm thinking, I would be preventing my wife from honoring her dog. (2) I would be crushing a dream shes had for a long time. She's also the one carrying the baby so I think she deserves to have more of a say over it than I do but I am completely against this.

I, 31M, am expecting my first kid with my wife of 2 years, 26F. We have been together for 3.5 years. We met at a bar and instantly clicked. She has always wanted to be a mom and considers herself a 'maternal' person. She is 6 months pregnant and it has been an easy pregnancy. We both have relatively established jobs and make well above our means. We both have debt remaining from school, but we make our payments on time etc. All of this is to say that our relationship is stable and developed and there aren't really any external problems. Our families love each other, we have friends separate from each other, and everything is healthy.

We have one problem though. She is absolutely dead set on naming our kid after her deceased dog from when she was a child. I honestly think this is really strange. We are having a girl and the name isn't a 'human' name (in my opinion). I don't want to say exactly what it is but it's pretty similar to Lucky. I feel uncomfortable about naming our daughter a dog name. I don't think that dogs lives are less valuable than human lives, however our daughter is going to have a life beyond us. I would be weirded out if I were named after a dog. I don't know how to approach this subject with my wife because she has wanted to name her future child after her childhood dog since she was a teenager. WIBTA if I refused to name our kid after her dog? I don't want a blow up fight over this but I feel like this will affect our future child in the long term.

Though, a human name. He thought it was cool. And funny as he got older.


That being said... if its not a human name in your culture... that's not the greatest idea. Has it been done successfully? Sure... but it's rare. We've all laughed at unique names and tragedies enough to know it's not a good idea.

Examples of alternatives: (Pretending it is lucky, just substitute the actual name she wants)

Names whose *meanings* mean lucky or is tied to luck.

Names that share the same meaning.
(Many Names and words share the same intent or meaning. )

Names similar to Lucky, like Lucy, Lucretzia,  Lucian, etc.

The dog breed... a name tied to lucky breed in some way. 
(Lucky was a St. Bernard.  Saint and Bernard are Names. Heinrich Schumacher developed the breed, so Heinrich is also a name) 

Use the lucky name as the middle name.

Use the lucky as a nickname.


  I'm not saying stick with these, but do some homework, research and come to her with a list of names using this template that are human... that could also warm her up to shifting off her hyper focus of ""lucky"", and open her up to different names and maybe honoring her love of this animal in a more... acceptable way... and then maybe completely.

1. Women get to choose because biology made it so they get to choose. 

2. Women usually stay because biology made it so that, if they choose not to abort a child, it's generally because they want the child. 

3. Men walk away because unlike women, they can't change their minds about having a baby AFTER having sex. Women can absolutely change their minds after sex, as you've very clearly acknowledged. Women abort, but men cannot do that, so the only thing they can do, is walk away. 

4. She ""risks her life"" for two reasons, the first being HER FUXKING CHOICE, and the second being BIOLOGY.

All of those things are literally nothing to do with OP. He didn't choose to be born male. There is 0 reason to suspect he forced the woman to get pregnant and then keep the baby. She made that choice. 

This next bit might be controversial to many, but hey ho - I'm going to say it anyway. Worth noting that I am a biological woman, just in case anyone decides to scream at me about being a disgusting man who is trying to justify abandoning a child - that is not the case, I am not a man, I have never and would never advocate for abandoning a child - but I do understand some of the reasons why it happens.

In developed countries, women can have as much sex as they like, and get pregnant as often as they like, and they can pick and choose which pregnancies to keep and which to abort whenever they damn well please. Men have sex once and have absolutely no ability to change their minds afterwards as to whether they want a baby or not - women having sex doesn't mean they choose to have a baby, but men having sex means they automatically DO choose to have a baby.

I might be the asshole because I’m considering not helping my ex while she’s pregnant with our child when I'm able to down the road.She’s only 10 weeks pregnant right now, and there’s a good chance I’m the father (her behavior makes me question it though).

My 35F ex broke up with me 34M about 1 month ago today. We dated for over a year and towards the end of June, she was admitted to a mental health hospital for having a mental breakdown. When she was admitted, we also discovered she is pregnant. She gave me the news (the doctors confirmed later), by telling me she hated me, she didn't want to be with me, and I am the worst person ever... oh and that she was pregnant. My shock and lack of positive response to that ""confirmed"" what she needed to know about our future. Apparently she decided to be done then, but didn't fully confirm it until later.

During her time at the hospital, she was very difficult to deal with. I was told her diagnoses were bipolar 1, BPD, and PTSD. Previously she told me the first 2 were misdiagnoses, but her family said she was properly diagnosed and that in the past had stopped both medication and therapy and eventually landing back into a mental hospital. This last stint was her 4th visit in her adult life. The hospital was 2 hours away and I visited 4 times: twice to deliver clothing and supplies, once for a failed therapy session, and finally to bring her home. I have provided her with $900 cash, and $210 in various goods (clothes, supplies, vitamins). I also spent $170 in gas for the 4 round trip visits. I then helped her pack her things, sent her home, and then told her I needed time to process the last 2 weeks (her mania was really bad a few days prior to the hospital visit, and she was in the hospital for 1.5 weeks). She took that as abandoning her and our child, and 1 week later confirmed our break up when I tried to address my concerns, stating she did not want to be with me, and considered us co-parents.

Since then, our communication was basically no contact unless it was baby related. She blocked me everywhere except the phone. I ask about the baby's health 1-2 times a week, and for upcoming appointment information. I went to the first one, the second one was an emergency visit due to intense pain and she got an ultrasound, and the third one was a heartbeat appointment, which I was denied going since it ""wasn't really baby related"".

So far, I have not physically seen or heard any confirmation about this baby. She has asked me 3 times to send her money for groceries (nothing else). I have expressed my financial situation has taken a turn, but she refuses to accept that as an answer and determines my lack of financial assistance confirms I do not care for our child. I offered to help later, and for now at least send some protein bars or something via an Amazon subscription, but she refused and demanded either home chef meals or paying for groceries. My financial situation has broken down as follows:
- I had to go to trial for a different matter and that cost several thousand dollars.
- Mice did about $4000 in damage to my car.
- I needed and paid for 2 CT scans.

WIBTA if I ended up refusing to help her any further, even after I rebalance my situation?

n8f81ep,1moqfie,AmItheAsshole,Shefcat,"I’m really not trying to be snarky but the bottom line is this woman is pregnant with your baby and has asked for help with the groceries. You didn’t present the whole conversation that you had with your ex. You just said that she asked for a home chef and you offered protein bars. I realize that there is a word limit for the sub but the way it was worded in the post you sounded very nonchalant. 

I’m confused by your comment about her cutting you off because it sounds as if you told her you wanted to be no contact with her. That she was hospitalized for two weeks and you brought her home and then sort of told her “I gotta take some time to figure this out” and she took that as “I don’t want to deal with you or this kid.”  Now, you might not have meant it that way but as a third party with no stakes in this situation by best advice it that you two need to figure out a way to communicate better. 

Yes she sounds like she deceived you about the bipolar diagnoses. Or, is it possible that the mental illness contributes to the denial itself? I’m not an expert in bipolar disorder or some of these other mental health issues but I do know that mental health tends to get downplayed. If your ex had been hospitalized for cancer treatment would you be as angry as you are now about her diagnosis? If she were dealing with cancer would you be open to buying her groceries? Maybe cancer is not the best comparison but mental health issues can be as serious to deal with. 

I mean, look, buy groceries or not. I don’t really care. Sounds like she’ll figure it out one way or another but I think supporting the mother of your child is a good thing to do. And even though you have these other expenses that you’re dealing with, is helping her with $50 of groceries a week going to tip you into financial ruin?

I merely tried to state that as of now, I'm unable to help at that scale and I can provide something on the smaller end until my financial situation rebalances a bit. She refused to accept that, seeing it as a refusal to help since she wasn't getting what she wanted. It'd be different if I straight up said ""nope, not my problem.""

Yeah I did tell her I needed some space. I couldn't get into detail how rough those 2 weeks were. Being yelled at daily, blamed for everything, claiming I should be in the mental hospital instead of her, it's my fault she was there, I don't care about her, then demanding I drop everything to bring her stuff (including getting someone to watch my son to help her because the unborn baby is a higher priority). It was a roller coaster I needed to recover from. I asked for physical space, I still spoke with her electronically. We all make mistakes with communicating, and typically you allow someone to try and elaborate, but she accepted what she wanted to hear. Again, doesn't really matter because she told me our relationship ended in June... and I picked her up before the 4th of July. So technically, she already decided we were broken up either right before or during her hospital visit and I was along for the ride until she made it very clear to me a week later. It was strange she continued to call me her boyfriend and SO in front of others until that day but oh well.

Considering that her mental health issues are not keeping her from working full time, earning her entire normal income, and allowing her to pay her rent and bills without issue... yeah I am a little less sympathetic. She isn't in a debilitating situation where she's bedridden or can only work part time. A few days ago, I was told she was out roller skating and messing with her friends while doing so. She makes decent money too, and has a lot in her savings, more than I do at this point.

Right now... I have $29 in my checking until the 22nd. My next paycheck I might have some available to help, but I'm not sure. The paycheck before I had $50 left for 2 weeks. I barely ate, and focused on getting groceries for my son. Lawyers don't take IOUs, and neither do repair shops. It sucks this all happened back to back, but it won't be like that forever. I just have the means to handle this wisely, and I think it's best to at least consider that.

n8f5do0,1moqfie,AmItheAsshole,DaddyVader79,"Your comment about my trial having to do with someone receiving judgment against me... I stated zero facts about that trial besides the fact it cost me a lot of money. That's why I said it was bold for you to assume anything about it, not that it was bold for you to assume anything else.

My apologies, I thought mentioning 3 expensive situations happening back to back would convey how big of a financial hit I went through. I can assure you if those expenses were minor for me, I wouldn't be posting here. I would have sent the money and called it a day.

Yeah it's possible the baby is mine, but given how early the pregnancy was when we found out, the fact we never lived together and spent plenty of time apart, and that she lied about her diagnoses... I can't rule out the possibility that its not mine.

My 8 year old isn't blind... they noticed the car isn't in the driveway anymore. I didn't tell them everything, but saying the car is getting fixed and will be back soon isn't a bad thing.

Honestly, I did and do want more kids, but I never thought I'd find out I'm gonna be a father again and the mother wants nothing to do with me all at the same time. Yeah we could have been more careful, we both took risks and here we are. I'm not saying I don't want to help at all, but this time during the pregnancy affords me the ability to prepare for the future. If I didn't go in the hole several thousands, I wouldn't be posting here either. As of now, I not only need to recover financially, I also need to put money towards that child's life outside of utero. They'll need diapers, formula, clothes, etc. All stuff I need to provide on my own, while she has family to help.

Correct me if I am wrong here... but the way you worded that last part... I don't imagine you would disregard the father of your child when they're offering to support you emotionally, physically, and financially, instead choosing to break things off and only accept financial support on your terms. I'd imagine you would be understanding if the father told you ""hey, I just needed to spend over $7000 due to some troubles that happened back to back. I'm sorry I can't provide a lot of help right now and I'm working to fix that. Can I send you some protein bars or something until then so you at least get something extra until I can do more for you and the baby?"". I understand that with her mental health crisis, she's not thinking like others would... but even when proposed with a temporary option and a plan to do better down the road once life balances out... would you really think they don't care and that honestly show you the father considers a child an afterthought? If the money isn't there, is it truly a good idea to expect someone to go into debt to help you, especially when the cost of caring for the child increases drastically once they're born? Wouldn't it be better to have the father of your child provide proper stability and support for your child, especially given how early the pregnancy is and there is plenty to prepare for?

Yes, I did ask for opinions while supplying as much information as I can. Unfortunately, AITA only allows 3000 characters per post, and discourages continuing the post via comments. I'm always happy to elaborate further. Frankly, not only am I stuck on whether I can or should help, I'm also dealing with the heartbreak of our relationship ending, the heartbreak that child will be born into a split home, and the prospect their mother may not be able to care for them given their mental health issues and refusal to get proper care. That puts them in potential danger, especially with some of the stories I've heard from people with mismanaged bipolar or BPD parents... it can be pretty bad.",1,2025-08-12 22:35:47,True,WIBTA if I refused to provide continued financial assistance to my pregnant ex?,208,2025-08-12 17:52:45,150,,,,,,[]

As a kid, I never had a birthday party until I was 4 or 5. And even then, it was a small, mostly family thing. But my cousins and friends with babies go nuts. My cousin had a party for daughter's first birthday recently. It was cowboy themed, had at least 50 guests, an open bar, professionally catered...just absurd for someone who won't remember it. Then everyone is supposed to just...gaze adoringly at the baby, endlessly. Like yes, she's cute. But this kid had a camera or phone on her the entire day and evening. (To say nothing of social media privacy.)

I know there's a ton of pressure, especially on moms, to be super involved and go all out for every occasion. But I feel like it's setting these kids up to have Main Character Syndrome. A baby's first birthday costing more than most graduations is just wild to me.

A lot of people (mostly grandparents and immediate family) EXPECT and sometimes demand constant updates, while others are annoyed by that. A big group chat is a great way to handle this I think, because people can interact to their comfort level. A group chat is actually a lot LESS pressure than an individual text, I doubt anyone including your friend would notice if you didn’t respond in such a huge group. The issue is some people (including OP) do still feel obligated to respond, but I don’t think you are.

My solution was similar, I set up a photo sharing app for baby pics and sent to close friend and family, but I am certainly not expecting responses!! I had a close friend use the same app and I turned off notifications, every few weeks I’ll jump on and look at the latest pics and comment a few times.

My best friend had a baby and she LOVES to take and send photos of that baby, which is understandable. Babies are adorable and all consuming. I live far away from
her. Sometimes she sends me like 25 photos at a time. I know she’s just wanting to share her life with me, and her kid is the most important part of her life.

I am childfree by choice and while I love my friends’ kids, I’m not much of a “baby person.” I try to love and appreciate babies, but it’s always a stretch. I feel bad about this sometimes, but that’s just how I feel.

My friend is very comfortable starting huge group texts and welcoming lots of cross talk. When she was in labor, she started a 120 person group what’s app, for example. When she has a mental health crisis, she’ll start a 30 person group chat with a bunch of people I don’t know. In some ways, it’s something I admire about her - she’s unafraid of asking for support and to be witnessed during the big moments in her life, and she values including people. Other parts of me find this behavior to be kind of entitled. Maybe I’m too afraid to
Just start a huge group chat about a big thing in my life, and therefore I judge her for it. But I also just find it intrusive.

Anyways, recently she added me to a 70 person what’s app group for daily photos of
Her baby. I messaged her that sadly I did not want to participate because I use what’s app for work and other things, and I find huge chats overwhelming, but that I’ll gladly continue to receive pics in our 1:1 texting. She seemed pretty hurt and pointed out that I have no issue being in another friend’s what’s app group about her baby. That’s true - but that’s because that other friend only posts once a month or so and is much more thoughtful about how much she uses the group.

I feel this is honestly causing a rift between us. It feels so petty - and yet it also feels deep somehow. Sometimes I wonder if I’m just a huge curmudgeon and should have sucked it up and been quietly annoyed about the group but not said anything. However it’s clearly about a deeper issue - the ways in which we feel or dont feel entitled to the attention of others.

One last thing to note - she added me to
The group during the most important weekend of my career, where I was facilitating a very high stakes and emotional retreat (which my friend knew about). In some
Ways, because I am childfree by choice, my career IS my baby - but it’s not something seen and cherished by others like a baby is.

Anyways, I welcome your insights! Thanks.

n8cox32,1moh7i6,AmItheAsshole,Pretty_Outcome_307,"NTA!!! 

I see that a lot of people are suggesting you mute the thread from this friend in order not to hurt her feelings. I disagree. What about your feelings? As a fellow childless woman, I share your slightly  ambivalent feelings towards babies and I would have done same as you, although actually I would have removed myself from the chat without explaining myself to her. If someone adds me to a group chat without my permission I have the equal right to take myself out of it, as do you.

My friends and acquaintances are all now thankfully beyond the age when they were regularly sending out baby pics, but for years I found that behaviour remarkably insensitive. None of them ever asked whether it was OK with me. And none of them ever had a conversation with me to explore my feelings about my childlessness, so they had no idea whether my lack of children was a private source of grief to me or not. 

Putting all that general over-excited insensitivity from many new parents to one side, your friend is incredibly self-centred and entitled. She's totally ""me, me, me"". The yummy mummy behaviour that assumes parents and their children are the centre of the universe and their feelings count more than those of single people drives me mad. And she is the worst example of this that I have ever heard of! Regularly dropping 30 pics of her baby and expecting 70 people to go ""yay!"" and respond with happy comments and heart emojis is beyond ridiculous. Why is she so needy and demanding of attention? She sounds exhausting. 

You may find that you need to tone this friendship down in more ways than just on WhatsApp, as the rift you are feeling is a real one. You no longer share mutual values on what is important in life. In your life, her baby is not a priority as you forge your career and live your best life. In her life, her baby is beyond important and your feelings are no longer of interest to her unless they align with hers, with her baby at the pinnacle. 

On the one hand I think this can be quite common as friends naturally diverge over time in their directions in life, but I have plenty of friends who are parents who didn't mind me not being on the same journey with them, and were not conditional in their accepance of me as a childless friend. On the other hand your friend is off the scale needy and you shouldn't feel obligated to feed her insatiable demands for positive affirmation, not least because she has 69 other people willing to do so.",4,2025-08-12 13:33:20,False,AITA for not joining my best friend’s 70 person what’s app with daily photos of her baby?,616,2025-08-12 11:45:13,141,,,,,,[]

A friend's wife and I are no longer on good terms because of her ""me, me, me"" posts on social media. If I didn't comment on one of her posts, she would text me. She thinks that her son, her trips to the gym, the number of guys who (allegedly) hit on her in high school and when she was in her 20s, etc. is huge news. She also likes to believe that she is special because she gave birth (her son is now in college) so when I mentioned that women had been giving birth for thousands of years she blew a gasket.

It's people like your friend that drive friends away with their obsessions but firmly believe the problem is with everybody else.

As others have suggested, you can put the group on mute. When you have time, you can look at the 5,000 pictures your friend send in the past week.

n8crrz9,1moh7i6,AmItheAsshole,Late-Ad-1020,"Hmm, thank you so much for this perspective. I appreciate you standing up for childfree people. Reading everyone’s responses is making me think more deeply about why I felt the need to leave the group AND communicate it to my friend. It seemed a bit silly and unnecessarily confrontational. But I think you’re speaking to this other layer - I don’t want babies to have to be the center of my universe. I want my career to matter as much as someone deciding to give birth to a child. Society does not value these things equally. The same is true with marriage.
We’re expected to drop everything and spend a lot of money on travel and gifts for a wedding, but we don’t really celebrate our single friends milestones with the same expected care. I’m partnered now, but for years I was single and resented this about weddings.
I moved to a new country this year and essentially adopted my partner’s teenage daughter. There is no recognition, I feel, of the unique experience of becoming a step parent. I never wanted to be a parent, but this is just how my life unfolded (and I’m very grateful!). There is no baby shower, no presents, no outpouring of support when you become a stepparent. I don’t need presents or attention. But there’s a part of me that wants to rebel against these imbalances.

Sheesh. I have a lot to process and let go of. It’s no one’s fault for these norms, and certainly not the fault of my friend. But I appreciate you helping me see that I was attempting to set a boundary for a meaningful reason.

n8f7jn9,1moh7i6,AmItheAsshole,Meowth_the_kitten,"Really disagree with you here about muting not being the answer.

When I had my first baby, suddenly EVERYTHING in my life was in relation to the baby. When I ate, when I slept, how I could go to a shop, my marriage, how I hung out with people. Words can't describe how extreme the life change is. It took me a few months to realise that most people really don't care that my baby slept through the night or grew a tooth or vomitted everywhere or laughed for the first time. And once I did, I realised I liked having a persona that wasn't baby-centered. I really liked re-discovering parts of my identity that weren't about baby and it felt really good having interactions outside this.

I guess what I would suggest in this situation is put her on mute for now to not offend anyone then when she's feels like doing something non-baby, you're there and not someone she's been burned by. Let her have her baby bubble and you can not engage.

With new parents, my advice is: just smile and say 'cute' and back off a bit from the baby-obsessed social media grab-outs.  Some mothers are clueless in not realising how little others care about their baby, others have more insight, but all are completely preoccupied, and it will spill into social interactions.

For anyone calling OP controlling or that the relationship is way or nay- leaving it out of the question, this sister is abusive and everyone but OP's GF can see that, plain simple.

Now, OP is on their total right to bail out of any relationship for whatever reason, and this one seems like a really big one since GF's sister openly tries to get her to ruin their relationship and outright dislike it.

If GF respects OP and their dynamic, she would at least acknowledge the elephant in the room and seems to refuse it altogether. She's doing none of that and instead being insistent on going ahead with the trip, ergo, she cares little for what OP thinks, feels and whatever her sister has planned ahead seems better for her.

TL; DL: my gf wants to go on an international trip with her sister who has put her in compromising positions more than once. AITA for saying if she goes on this trip I walk?

So I (25M) have been dating my gf (20F) for a while. We are long distance and have a pretty healthy relationship.

We are currently fighting over an upcoming trip she wants to take to Colombia with her older sister. Typically I wouldn’t have a problem with this, as I am always for traveling and seeing the world, even if I can’t be apart. The issue his her sister. Let me explain: 
- her sister has constantly tried to get my gf to cheat on me while out. “Who cares, everyone does it” her words. 
- her sister had kicked her out and left her stranded more times than once
- on a recent trip, her sister was the only negative part for literally everyone there. 
- she has put my gf in a lot of uncomfortable situations and has spoken to her very poorly whenever my gf doesn’t do what she wants. 
- she has 0 respect for our relationship or quite honestly anybody but herself.

My gfs mom, grandma and best friend have all told her that that her sister is bad news. 

My gf now thinks that I am holding her back and “ruining a great opportunity” and I am being controlling because I said no. I usually am laid back, but my gf always asks me if she can do stuff, and I nearly always say yes unless it’s something I’m really uncomfortable with, and she’s always listened even if I got push back. 

This time my gf is absolutely refusing or just can’t see my point as to why I don’t want her to go on this trip with her sister. Literally any other person I would be fine with. 

AITA for telling me gf that if she goes on this trip then I walk out of the door?

HOWEVER. You have legit concerns regarding her sister's behavior, based on her past actions. Valid. 

If it were my daughter, I'd let her know I'm concerned for her physical safety. There's no doubt in my mind her sis WILL put her in a compromising situation. Especially worrisome in Columbia. (We've all read news stories. Don't get me wrong, I travel to South American countries. But always with a trusted person.) 
You have the same fears. You didn't mention if you're in the US or if she's white. But if you are, and she's not... definite no. My white (male) friend was detained for HOURS coming back from Mexico. 

Maybe just sit her down? You're concerned for her safety. You do not trust her sis to look out for her or stick to the buddy system. You don't trust border patrol (if from US.) It's not gf. It's the fact that she's going with sis & sis ALONE. 

Let her know you'd be open to a trip with a trusted person or offer to take her yourself with sis. (I know, it would suck, but at least she'd have someone watching out for her.)

Saying you'll break up with her if she goes, isn't getting your ACTUAL concerns out, & will definitely push her to conceivably put herself in a dangerous situation. 

You have to understand. She probably loves her older sis & looks at her through rose colored glasses.

n8ev2kr,1mosblh,AmItheAsshole,Vyckerz,">You *are* trying to control her instead of setting boundaries with the goal of making her responsible for her choices

Explain how saying this was a boundary for him because of who the sister is as a person and not because he doesn't necessarily trust his GF, and that he will leave if she crosses that boundary, is not setting boundaries.

It's not about controlling her as he literally said she could go on a trip without him with anyone except for that person, so it's about the risk associated with the sister and not about control.

Understand here, everyone apparently knows the sister is a bad influence and untrustworthy  and that by OP's GF ignoring his concerns she is showing very bad judgement given that the sister's past behavior shows a pattern that could result in OP being hurt or getting into trouble.  That Bad judgement would be what OP's boundary is about.  OP won't be in a  relationship with woman who has  bad judgement and ignores everyone's concern.

>Boundaries in this could look like ""if you go and end up in trouble,  I'm not helping you."" ""If your sister behaves badly,  I don't want to hear it."" ""If you go and I have to bail you out or listen to you complain for the next 2 months, I'm done with the relationship."" That puts logical consequences in place that have nothing to do with controlling her, amd it's the same end result. You don't want to be tied to her sister's chaos,  she doesn't want to be limited. There's a middle ground. 

By your logic OP should say nothing.  She goes on the trip and gets, killed, raped or trafficked (not unlikely as she's going to Columbia) due to the sister's pattern of putting her in bad situations and I guess OP has the consolation of being able to say ""I new I was right"".

Why not just break up when she goes and not have to deal with any of what you mentioned.

In fact, OP should break up with her just for the fact that she chooses to stay close and go on this trip with someone who is a stated enemy of their relationship.  That is enough to justify the breakup.",21,2025-08-12 21:11:21,False,AITA for not letting my gf (20F) go on a trip with her sister,113,2025-08-12 19:20:54,182,,,,,,[]

Trying to enforce certain behaviour on another person, with an explicit threat of something happening if they don't comply is controlling behaviour.

You are, quite literally, trying to control the way they act through a threat.

Sure, why not?

Are you suggesting if someone hits their partner, but their partner didn't explicitly say ""if you hit me I will leave"", then said partner cannot just leave?

Also, why are you creating a false dichotomy by suggesting that they only two options are never mentioning a topic, or threatening a person if they do said topic? It is perfectly reasonable to discuss things you like or don't like without incorporating a threat.

Even if you don't think she's a burden, \*she\* does and she doesn't like it.She's told you how she feels, and instead of listening to her, you've come here.  

Go back, talk to her, and if she wants to pay every once in a while, accept it graciously.  There's a lot of stuff she can't do right now, but paying once in a while is something she can do.  When you don't let her do so, it can feel infantilizing to her, even if that's 100% not what you mean.

First, she certainly must be suffering from trauma.  Hopefully she is getting emotional therapy along with any physical therapy.   An accident that requires 3 weeks in the hospital had to be severe.  

It is difficult for an independent person to suddenly have to depend on someone else - anyone else - for everything financial.    

In no way am I saying this is going on….  There is a reality that too many women face where control over their lives begins with financial control.   

Talk to her.  Explain you were looking at this as supporting your partner.   If she isn’t comfortable with you paying for everything, come to an agreement on what financial help she is comfortable taking.

After being sidelined for two months she certainly must be feeling the need to get back to some normalcy.

My fiancée (25F) got into an accident in June. She was in the hospital for 3 weeks and has been recovering at home since. She’s a tattoo artist, so her income depends entirely on having clients. She hasn’t worked since the accident and has been living off her savings (her mom helped with rent in July). I started buying groceries for her, paying for her dog's food and refusing to let her pay for anything when we did something together (I have a stable income and a good salary that allows me to do this).

Last night we went to a restaurant. We ate. We drank. The bill came, I automatically took it and paid. Back in the car, she asked me how much it was. I said she didn't have to worry about it, I just wanted her to have a good time. Then she told me she was sick of me paying all the time and that it made her feel like a kid who couldn't take care of herself. I tried to explain that I don’t mind, that I’m just doing this until she’s back on her feet and working again and that I'm not expecting anything in return.

Now she’s being distant and keeps saying she “doesn’t want to feel like a burden.” I honestly thought I was helping and showing support. I’ve never once thrown it in her face or made her feel bad about it, so I’m confused.

AITA for paying for everything for my fiancée while she recovers?

n8dg7l8,1moh2md,AmItheAsshole,master0fcats,"NAH. You guys are going to be married. I've always appreciated the idea that marriage isn't always 50/50, sometimes it's 70/30 or 80/20 or what have you. It might be a good time to explore that idea and what that means. 

Don't know if this applies here, but it takes a lot of trust to know that someone won't hold that support against you in the future, and a lot of people who would give freely when they are able won't accept support because they don't want it to become an obligation when the tables are turned. 

She might also be feeling uncomfortable knowing that if the tables were turned *right now,* she doesn't have the same type of stability to be able to help you in the same way.

Her feeling like she's a burden and no longer independent means also that she does not feel good relying on you. That trust can only come with time.

I would try calm communication now that some time has passed since your birthday. Try to keep the conversation on how you feel/felt and try to keep what you felt negative about not to contain what they did, but a result of that. If it helps, have it written down to reference when talking to them. 

Example-
 “When I was told that I could have a birthday party at our house, I was super excited and under the impression that it would be who I was planning to invite and us getting to do what I wanted to do within reason. That was my understanding and expectation leading up to my birthday. I felt disappointed when I saw people who I didn’t invite to my party because I had planned to have only people there that I knew and wanted to celebrate with me on my special day. I tried to be flexible and adaptable though by being a good host with the people I did know, my friends. When my friends wanted to go on the trampoline, younger kids were playing on it and wouldn’t give us a turn even though they had been on it a long time. I didn’t feel like the other guests were here to celebrate me especially when I asked their parents for a turn and they didn’t seem very nice about it. It made me upset when I couldn’t have my cake because another guest who I didn’t invite threw up on it. I really wanted my birthday to be how I envisioned with the people I wanted to celebrate with. I wanted to be a good host and didn’t intend to come off as ungrateful, but I was caught off guard by having people there who I felt didn’t care to celebrate me on my birthday. I didn’t want to continue to celebrate feeling this way so I left to my room.

I (14M) had a birthday in July. 2 weeks before my birthday I asked my parents if I we could host my birthday party at our house. They agreed and I was so excited, I invited a bunch of my friends to the party so we could all celebrate together. Fast-forward to the birthday party, I was disappointed because there were little kids aged 3-8 at my birthday party. I didn't know who these kids were, but apparently my parents invited a few families that they were close to, to MY birthday party. I asked my parents ""Why are there kids I don't know here? I asked you guys that I only want my friends to be here."" My mom said, ""First of all, do not give me that attitude. Second of all, I think we should celebrate your birthday with more people."" I didn't know these people, but I was generous at first. My friends and I decided to go to our trampoline in the backyard but there were 2 kids in them, I think they were around 7 years old. I asked the kids to leave the trampoline because we were going to play rough. They said they aren't going to leave. (The kids were on the trampoline for 2 hours prior). We asked their parents if they can leave. Their parents responded, ""C'mon man, let them have fun."" I was screaming inside because this was exactly why I didn't want anyone else to come. When everyone was singing happy birthday, one of the kids threw up on the cake. I stormed off, ran into my room and shut the door. My parents opened the door and scolded me, ""You better get back down there, do not be ungrateful."" I yelled at them, ""You guys invited these people I didn't know to MY birthday party! Don't even call me ungrateful, because you guys know the cake is my favorite part!"" My Mom stood there in shock and my Dad took my phone away for talking back. My friends came up and said that they were also annoyed, we played on the xbox for the rest of the night to calm down. So, AITA for yelling at my parents because they invited people I didn't know?

I am going with NTA

But I need a little more context is this all you asked for your birthday? Did you get gifts from the people that came, especially gifts that you actually wanted or needed? If they gave you gifts, like money or gift cards then maybe yes AITA. Because even though those brats caused you trouble, if they bought you some good stuff I would have personally tolerated it. However if they didn't bring gifts and just showed up, then well, that's a big problem. 

I mean, I would be pretty happy if I had a 14 year old and they wanted a birthday party at the house, its easy and low cost, birthday parties at places can run hundreds and hundreds of dollars especially for a teenager because the teen appropriate places are usually more expensive then those geared towards younger kids.

On the other hand it is YOUR birthday, and parents should respect what kids want for their birthday, especially when they agreed to give you a birthday party. If they really didn't care, then they should have not given you a birthday party in the first place. Next year, if they still agree to give you a birthday party, I would find an expensive place and ask for it there.

One thing I think we can all agree on, puking on the cake, that is wayyyyyy over the top (especially if it was an expensive cake, cakes are really expensive everywhere now) and that parent should profusely apologize to you regardless of anything else said here, and should have automatically ran to the store and gotten you another cake, even if it was a grocery store cake.

I have kids (they are adults now) and can't imagine turning their party into my party with grownups whose kids get to be shafted into your party. Your parents are friends with those other adults and used your party as a way to entertain their kids so they could take a break from parenting.

I know you are angry, rightfully so, but try to push it back a bit to have a conversation with your parents. Practice what you want to tell them. If you can manage to push back the anger some and talk calmly to your parents, though it's okay to show your hurt, explain how hurt you are that your birthday party was turned into a daycare for their adult friends kids. It is one day a year you wanted to be about you to celebrate with your friends and it was ruined by the misbehavior of their friend's kids.

The malice in how OP’s parents spoke to him, and their permissiveness to allow _their_ friends’ kids to ruin the party, doesn’t bear even a lick of humor. As a kid who is still developing his sense of self, OP doesn’t have any obligation to try to make lemonade out of lemons. It’s possible that he could look back on this shitshow in 20 years and chuckle at how absurdly his parents failed him, but for a 14 year old, the wound is a little too fresh right now and he likely doesn’t have a maturely developed archive of feelings to reference to process what just happened to him in a healthy and mature way.

As grownups, we should acknowledge that it was painful to be embarrassed/humiliated and for his feelings to be trampled on his special day. Of course it’s not the end of the world, and it’s important to maintain the perspective that birthdays are a privilege and a treat, but our job as grownups is to make sure that the kids in our orbit can still have magical and innocent childhoods. OP should definitely keep avenues of communication open, but as a kid it’s not his job to do adult things, so we should allow him to feel his feelings even if it’s in a big way like yelling or crying. The onus is on his parents to help guide him towards finding healthy ways to express himself.

n8cz0ua,1moi2yw,AmItheAsshole,SaraAB87,"Ok well at least in my family that's 100% being an asshole, you don't just show up at a birthday party expecting to be fed (I assume there was food other than the cake provided) and entertained on another families dime without bringing at least a small gift for the birthday person. And if you do show up in this way, then you at least bring food to contribute to the party. At least in my family you don't do such a thing as its not proper etiquette. If you go to a birthday party, you don't walk in without a gift for the birthday person. In my family you would be talked about for a long time for being rude, and probably would not be invited to another party.

Even if you are really poor, if you can show up at a party you can buy the kid or person a $5 gift, doesn't have to be fancy but you need to give a gift to show your appreciation and because its a birthday. If its a little kid party you can get away with 1-2 trinkets from the dollar store. I have run into situations where people couldn't afford larger gifts and were invited to a lot of parties in school and it became overwhelming for them, however those people always bought at least a $5 gift or gave $5 to the birthday kid in a card, for a grade school kid party this is fine.  Its not the amount of the gift or what is spent on it but its to show the person you care about them and aren't just there for the free food and entertainment.

The only exception would be if the family was rich and specified no gifts necessary on the invitation but that's such a rare situation it almost never happens. Even in this case you should contribute something small like food or bring a small gift for the birthday person to show your appreciation.

The only good thing is when you get older its going to become a funny story like everyone else said and it won't matter as much.",-2,2025-08-12 14:23:11,False,AITA for yelling at my parents because they ruined my birthday party?,258,2025-08-12 12:17:12,128,,,,,,[]

So I (27M) live in a small apartment above my parents’ garage. My sister (25F) still lives at home. We’ve always been close-ish, but lately she’s been bringing her boyfriend over constantly.

A few months ago, she asked for my Wi-Fi password because the signal upstairs is better. I gave it to her. A week later, I noticed the internet was sluggish. I checked my router and saw seven new devices connected. Turns out she gave my password to her boyfriend “just for one night,” but then he gave it to his friends so they could “download something quickly.”

I confronted her, she laughed it off, and said, “It’s just Wi-Fi, don’t be so dramatic.” I changed the password. She found out, got mad, and told my parents I was being petty. Now they’re telling me I should “just share” because it’s “family.”

I said I’ll happily share if she promises not to give it to anyone else. She refused, saying “I can’t control what people do.” So I refused too. Now she’s sulking, my parents are annoyed, and I’m getting side-eyed at dinner.

AITA for not giving her the new password?

This is a very serious issue. Protect yourself.

Your sister's response that ""I can't control what people do"" is exactly why you MUST NOT give your WiFi password to ANYBODY you do not know AND 100% trust, nor anybody who might give it to such an untrusted person. If somebody connected to your WiFi does something illicit then YOU may be held accountable as it's YOUR line being used. Responses here telling you how to set up a guest network or throttle her friends' bandwidth leave you open to legal consequences. You don't wanna end up on a register of sx offenders because some friend of your sister's used your wifi to do something unsavoury. You don't owe her an explanation, and telling her reasons such as this open the door for her to complain that you don't trust her friends. A valid response, which invites you to explain, ""correct, I don't know your friends, or anybody else who they might give access to my WiFi, nor what they might do while connected to my WiFi, nor what consequences that may have for me."" You're a young man with your life ahead of you. Don't risk fucking your life up by caving to her manipulative behaviour.

however, since you're getting attitude from multiple angles... see about getting a wifi router that has the guest network feature, and restrict the guest network to super low speeds (like modem speed, 56 kbps or something) then share the guest network password.

This malicious compliance will allow you to solve the optics problem, maintain a high ground with your parents, comply with your sister's demands, and make it completely useless so they won't want to use it, all while preventing them from filling your bandwidth with crap.  just don't brag about this setup.

n8cc5yb,1mnvteh,AmItheAsshole,GuttedPsychoHeart,"NTA OP. There was no freaking accident here. Your sister knew damn well that she had no business giving your Wi-Fi password to someone else, especially without your permission. She had no right to do that. The same goes for her boyfriend. And on top of it, who the hell is he to give out a Wi-Fi password to other people when it's not even his Wi-Fi? That's not only shitty, I'd even call that theft. Your sister has no fucking right to be mad at you for not sharing something that doesn't belong to her. If she wants Wi-Fi, she can pay for her own Wi-Fi. You allowed her to use your Wi-Fi out of the kindness of your heart and she straight up took advantage of that, giving it out to other people, when again, she didn't have your permission to do. 

Obviously she can't control what other people do, however she can easily just not give your Wi-Fi password to other people without your permission. She can definitely control that. Also, the whole ""family"" thing needs to stop. Tell your parents they can fuck off and need to understand that it's *your* Wi-Fi. You fucking *paid* for it. None of them did. ""Family,"" is just them not wanting to deal with your sister's self-centered and irresponsible behavior, not to mention incorrectly believing that family means being entitled to everything, even other peoples' things. That's not at all how family works and your parents should know that considering they're your parents. Your parents should be supporting you and backing you up. 

If I were you OP, I would cut ties with your parents, your family, and anyone else who wants to paint you as the issue. Hell, I live with my grandmother and little brother.

n8aiac8,1mnvteh,AmItheAsshole,ArthurDentsRobeTie,"> I think him saying “she still lives at home” but he lives in the “apartment” above the parents garage tells me all I need to know about this guy. Buddy you both still live at home, not that there’s anything wrong with that but the fact he feels like that’s an important distinction says a lot.

That's a lot of bad assumptions.

If OP calls it an ""apartment"" above the garage because they pay rent to live there, pay the bills (like WiFi), and otherwise do all the things someone living on their own would do, just in an apartment that their parents own, while the sister sponges everything, that is a HELL of an important distinction.

Shit, OP just having their own wifi they pay for is enough. It's OP'S WIFI. Living off parents, living off themselves, whatever, they're paying for separate wifi because they use enough wifi to need it. That's both responsible and considerate, paying out of pocket for something OP could be sponging off parents for a lot less. This shit from OP's sister, on the other hand:

> I said I’ll happily share if she promises not to give it to anyone else. She refused, saying “I can’t control what people do.”

...is exactly the OPPOSITE of responsible and considerate. She's not being asked to control what ""people"" do, she's being asked not to FUCKING HAND IT OUT TO OTHER PEOPLE HERSELF.

> I doubt he’s paying for the WiFi

And there's the shittiest assumption. Maybe we don't know for sure, but OP calling it ""my wifi password"" suggests it isn't the same fucking wifi that OP's parents have, so why would you assume otherwise with no evidence?

This isn't accurate. I believe you are thinking 2 different things. There's 2 different concepts here.

First off there's the router subnet... typically speaking that's 255.255.255.0 (also known as /24), what that means is from the router, if the routers IP is say 192.168.1.1, any addresses starting with 192.168.1 (except for 255 and 1) will work.

Next up is the routers DHCP rules. basically those are the addresses it will automatically give new devices that connect. 

So if the router has 192.168.1.1 with a 255.255.255.0 subnet.

and the DHCP table says 192.168.1.50-192.168.1.150. that means on the devices... you can manually set IP addresses 192.168.1.2-192.168.1.49. and 192.168.1.151-192.168.1.254 (IE you'd set that on the device itself not the router, usually there's an advanced settings when you connect to a router, and you can manually set an IP address, obviously these directions vary a lot by device).

DHCP is like the host at a restraunt, it seats people at the tables it is told to seat people.

However, if you manually set your IP on the device. that's basically like ignoring the host, and just sitting down wherever you want. Now if you are manually sitting at the group of tables the host uses, that can cause problems, (because if you didn't check in, with her, she won't cross it off, and she will try and sit someone at your table), but almost every routers default has a bunch of tables that aren't in the hosts area, in which case you can just walk past her, sit at the table and everything will be fine.",27,2025-08-12 07:51:38,False,AITA for refusing to give my sister my Wi-Fi password after she “accidentally” gave it to her boyfriend?,6603,2025-08-11 18:45:11,498,,,,,,[]

My friend and I decided to try a Japanese restaurant that had a great rating online. I got the soba salad and she got the chicken ramen. The food tasted good, and we were talking about how we should definitely eat here again. Just a few bites in, when she went to pull up her next bite of noodles from the broth, she noticed a dead gnat surface from the broth.

My friend is very shy and hates confrontation - but she also had a terrible food poisoning incident recently that has made her afraid to try new restaurants, and she was scared of eating the rest of the food. I assured her that she absolutely should not feel bad asking for a new plate, especially since she barely got to eat any of it (it was obvious she wasn’t trying to get free food or something)

She was super nervous but worked up the courage to get the waiters attention. After (as politely as humanly possible) pointing out the bug and asking if they could remake it, the server started arguing with her saying there’s no way the bug is from there kitchen and it must have come from outside (the open door in the front of the restaurant) and just landed on top. Which makes no because It was dead and was IN the broth when she found it, not on top… 

She explains this very calmly to him and the dude then STICKS HIS BARE FINGERS into her food and pulls it out, and starts laughing saying “you can just take it out - it’s not a big deal. See? It’s just from outside”. We were kind of just speechless and were like “Oh…. Okay…. Thanks”. He then goes to the kitchen for a minute and comes back and begrudgingly says “we’ll remake the dish but only a half-order” . Despite the fact that she barely got to eat any of her food. She just accepted it because she at this point just wants this to be over.

Then when he brings the tiny bowl of Ramen and realizes “oh oops - you had the chicken ramen?” He brought her a pork one. She says yes she got the chicken… and you can tell he doesn’t want to have to remake it again so he just asks her if the pork one is okay and she says yes (she didn’t want to make it worse). He charged her the full amount for a full order of chicken ramen and was very cold to us for the rest of our time there. She was worried thinking “maybe I should have just taken it out” and is now afraid of ever speaking up again. 

Was the waiter out of line?? I’m very upset for her and don’t want her to be afraid to speak up in the future.

I have to be super blunt with my husband—“you can’t go out in public looking like that,” and then he’ll get pissy but he will change his shirt.

My mother stopped taking care of her appearance and at first she said she was tired.  But she never seemed to get over the fatigue, and she took less care with her appearance.  When asked why she said was tired and in a lot.of pain and it was hard to take care of herself.  She eventually went to doctor, was diagnosed with a severe ailment and passed away 6wks later.

n8e9osc,1mopkxj,AmItheAsshole,coolest_crocodile,"You are NTA. However, he might be depressed or burned out. I am self-employed, a lot younger than your husband, and burned out. For the past year, I have worked crazy hours (easily 16 to 18 hours per day, seven days a week). Sometimes I really just don’t have the energy to brush my hair. It isn’t that I am lazy; I want to, I just don’t have the energy. To put on makeup seems like this huge task. Where I used to have pride in my appearance, I stopped caring. Recently I took a break from work. Got temporary help to cover everything I was doing. I slept for about six days straight. I woke up, went to the bathroom, ate something, and slept again. I slowly started feeling human again. Suddenly, my hair bothered me (I haven’t been to a hairdresser in over a year). I got a nice new hairstyle and treated myself to a spa day. I feel better than I did in months. 

I understand your concern, and I think you should be concerned. At the end of the day, a normal person would want their spouse to be happy, taken care of, and healthy. When was the last time he went for a physical? I would suggest you start with something small - a holiday/cruise where nobody knows you or him; so you wouldn’t be embarrassed. See if his attitude changes when he is relaxed? If he is willing to, get help. A good therapist can help enormously.

Because dementia can lead people to become unpredictable! My husband is the nicest guy in the world, but he also has become very moody and has undergone some personality changes. As a matter of public safety, I strongly urge you to incapacitate as many of your husband’s firearms as you can, or at minimum carefully and thoroughly unload all pieces and hide all ammunition boxes. I am also quite concerned that your husband blabs about his firearms outside of the home. This is certainly asking for your house to be burglarized! The leading source of guns used in crimes is burglary, which sidesteps all requirements for ID, licensing, registry or whatever the rules are in your state. If your husband is irritable and moody, you certainly should talk to your family doctor about the fact that he’s a gun owner.

We're in our 70s; we've been married for many decades. He is self-employed, so there is no required dress code. He used to take care of himself; however, he's grown his hair long (mid-back), often doesn't brush it, and will go out in public with it a tangled mess, or hair escaping his ponytail. He lost a tooth six years ago, got a prosthetic, and refuses to wear it. He smokes and drinks coffee, so his teeth are very stained, dark yellow/light brown. He won't use whitening strips or get them lightened by the dentist. Hair grows on and out of his nose; he shaves infrequently. He's been doing his own laundry for years and will wear wrinkled/dirty clothes in public. That is, unless he's going around people he wants to impress. 

He's now into collecting firearms and brags about new purchases to others. I've overheard, ""Why doesn't he do something about his teeth instead of buying new toys?"" He is quick to judge and make negative or rude comments about other people's appearance, but doesn't hold himself to the standards he holds others.

Frankly, I am embarrassed by his behavior and have stopped inviting him to business/social functions with me. (I'm socially and professionally active.) We have different last names, so I no longer mention I'm married to him. There have been situations where I did not introduce him. Don't get me wrong, I still love him even though I'm extremely annoyed. Divorce is not an option for me.

I take pride in my appearance. I brush my hair and remove under-eye makeup before I walk out of the bathroom in the morning. I am well-dressed at home and out in the world, as I have been since before we met. I'm frequently told I always look great. Although I'm now twenty-five pounds overweight, I'm always well groomed, stylish, and accessorized, even at home.

I tell him that I don't want people judging him and making fun of him. Husband says I'm being a \*\*\*\*, trying to control him, and he doesn't give a \*\*\*\* what people think about him. He says I am the only one judging him. Our adult kids are embarrassed by his appearance as well; they've asked me if he even brushes his teeth. Only two family members and one friend have dared to say something to him. He has no response to them.

So, AITA? I appreciate your unbiased opinions.

n87yllu,1mnv5xu,AmItheAsshole,LonelyOwl68,"I know there is a movement among long-haired people to not wash their hair as frequently as most would do, citing hair health issues like being stripped of oils and so on. It seems reasonable to me, not knowing all that much about it, but I assume they have their reasons. 

The issue here isn't how dirty her hair is, so much as the fact that it looks greasy and smells bad. This makes it a hygiene issue and you are well within your rights not to have to smell her hair during the ceremony. It would also be rude of her to subject everyone at the wedding to that funk. 

It's a wedding; a major ceremonial rite of passage that means a great deal to many people, especially to the bride and groom. It would be a matter of respect for your sister to wash her hair the day before, and it's hard to believe that washing it 4 or 5 days early would make that much of a difference. 

From what I have read about the less-frequent washing regimen, those who do so draw the line at their hair smelling and looking greasy. That's just ugly, and I will not be convinced easily that such hair is in any way healthy.

The action might make me the asshole because my sister called me a bridezilla. I may have been a bridezilla.

I gave her the ultimatum and she called me that cliche overused term, a bridezilla. She is still welcomed at my wedding either way. Am I bridezilla ? Am I the asshole ?

If I may offer some unsolicited advice....

1. If you can physically see she is actually oily (I appeared quite shimmery when I was oily and trying this technique if that helps any, idk lol) then I would tell her to look into skincare subreddits for oily skin or her age group and even make posts asking for advice. Lots of good starting points to point her in the right direction. 


2. If you love your sis and have that kind of a relationship with her and she has insurance coverage (I'm US-based so ofc I assume everyone else is too aha) maybe suggest she see a dermatologist about her oiliness. Skipping basic hygiene for the sake of not being greasy....double negative that just doesn't add up. Or if she's actually not greasy, maybe the derm will talk some sense into her. I've had a dermatologist ease my anxieties about scalp issues!!

Saying you’re not going to wash your hair before any wedding that you’re going to be in is selfish, nevertheless your sisters.

She can continue to “train” her hair after your wedding. She didn’t need to pick right before your wedding to be the hill to die on. If you want to go extra out of your way to be kind, you can get her a hair mask to use after, I really like the olaplex bonding one or the nourish ones.

n885aec,1mnv5xu,AmItheAsshole,PuddleOfHamster,"I was involved for years on a natural/long hair care forum, and tons of people, myself included, found they didn't have to wash their hair nearly as often after quitting using harsh shampoos that dried out their scalp and made them overproduce oil to compensate.  Updos and boar bristle brushing, and for some ladies, dry shampoo, kept their hair looking nice for ages between washings.

Nobody got ""damaged follicles"" (how?) from gradually stretching out washings. 

You can see photos of Victorian women with non-greasy-looking hair, and paintings of women (including ""gritty"" realistic paintings of lower-class women, not just fantasy vanity art), with hair that doesn't look greasy at all. It's unrealistic to assume that they had all washed their hair the day before the photo or the sitting.  And they washed their hair much less often than modern women do. They just knew how to brush the sebum down the hair shaft where it would act as a conditioner instead of pooling at the root making things oily. 

Now, that said, most of the women in this forum agreed that there was a relatively lengthy transition period of looking pretty greasy.

Listen, I’m not a trichologist or a dermatologist, but I did take classes on the science of hair/hair and scalp health, and I’ve read a lot of the studies that have come out. Bottom line- scalp health is the most important. Excessive oils can clog and damage hair follicles, which can cause breakage, acne, permanent hair loss, dermatitis, folliculitis, exacerbate psoriasis and eczema. Shampoo is used to treat the scalp, conditioner is used to treat the hair. If you have a drier scalp, you can easily get away with not washing your hair as often so it doesn’t get irritated and cause flakes and such. If you have an oilier scalp, you’d want to treat the excess so it doesn’t  clog follicles or result in hair loss. Again, not an expert, I’m someone with 20yrs in the business and experience with those trying the “balancing out” method.

n89d6z2,1mnv5xu,AmItheAsshole,PuddleOfHamster,"Yep, what she said.

Have you ever read the Little House on the Prairie books? There's a moment where Ma tells Laura her hair is getting rough and she should brush her hair for 100 strokes a night. This was common wisdom - you see the 100 strokes advice in all sorts of old women's periodicals and advice columns.

The brushes they used were boar bristle brushes, and boar bristles are just really good at catching and shifting oil.  Laura's hair really would have gotten smoother from a brushing regimen: not just because it was flattened or tamed by brushing, but because it was conditioned.

Think of how much animals groom themselves. They're oiling their coats, sometimes from oil at the hair follicle like we have, and sometimes from oil produced in a separate gland. Oil is produced by the body for a reason, not just to annoy us: its purpose is to keep the dead hair supple and moisturised. We call it 'healthy' even though the shaft of the hair is dead: it's the difference between dry, cracked leather and smooth,  moisturised, supple leather. And how do you keep leather in good condition? You oil it.

TL;DR: conditioner is fake sebum, boar bristle brushes are the shiz.",11,2025-08-12 02:24:46,False,AITA for telling my sister either she washes her hair before my wedding or she's not going to be a bridesmaids ?,4992,2025-08-11 18:15:51,509,,,,,,[]

n8cq9bh,1mnv5xu,AmItheAsshole,AutisticPenguin2,"Oh no, you need to give it at least a few solid weeks of no shampoo, and daily brushing. If I use product every 7 days, my hair is awful. You need to push through that oily patch by brushing daily to get the oils from the scalp down into the hair, and wait the full month before declaring it a failure. 

I feel like a lot of people here are trying to ease their way into it, trying to go 3 days without washing, then 5, then 7, but you really need to just go all in. Set aside a month to just not use anything on your hair, at all. I don't know if it will work for you - or any particular person, really - but every 5-7 days is not the technique I've been taught, and will not yield results no matter how long you try it for. And did I mention daily brushing? I suspect that may be important. 

I first heard about it from a guy with dreads, he said it took him about a month of not washing it to balance out and then his hair never needed to be washed. I didn't believe him at the time. Later my girlfriend let me in on the secret of how she maintained hair down to her thighs: she went about a month without washing before it balanced out, and brushed it twice a day. Finally I tried it myself, and after about a month of just brushing my hair was in the best condition it had ever been. 

I'm not trying to invalidate your experience, and I'm not pushing you to try something you don't want to, but *if you do* want to try this, then I really do think you will only see results of you go a full month of zero washing. Getting it wet is fine, but no soap, no shampoo, no salt or chlorinated water. And brush daily.

This is my first time on Reddit, please excuse any mistakes I make.

Ever since my (30F) and my now husband (31M) got together, we talked about how we both wanted a small wedding in the city we met, New Orleans. We both went to school there, but we live on the East Coast now. 

We're both very fortunate to have careers that pay us extremely well. So we knew we could have the wedding of our dreams. My husband's best friend from college owns a jazz club in NOLA and told us we could have our wedding there for free. We both chose vintage rings that didn't cost nearly as much as we budgeted for. My dress and his tux were both second hand from an amazing thrift store near us. We didn't choose anything crazy for cake, flowers, decorations, etc. We're not very materialistic people. Because of this, we had a lot of our wedding budget left over.

With the remainder of our budget, we decided to cover all the travel expenses for our 20 out of state guests. Including plane tickets, hotel, meals at the restaurants we wanted to take them to, my bridesmaids' dresses, his groomsmen's suits. We really didn't want any of our guests to put themselves out for our wedding. Especially since we chose to have it in a different state. We surprised them with this and there was a lot of tears and it was really sweet.

Fast forward to the day before everyone was supposed to leave for NOLA, I got a text from one of my guests, my close friend from college. She said after a lot of thinking, her and her husband found it inappropriate of us to have surprised them with covering their travel expenses. She said they felt offended that I assumed the couldn't pay for it, and they felt uncomfortable being ""controlled"" like that. So they wouldn't be attending I was genuinely just shocked. 

I couldn't deal with that so close to my wedding, so my amazing bridesmaids handled it for me. 

I even asked some of my other guests if they felt the same way, but everyone said no. Their plane and hotel tickets were nonrefundable and we got everyone custom gifts, so theirs are just sitting in my house now. 

Luckily, the wedding was absolutely amazing. Genuinely the best day of my life.

I'm just so at a loss about this. My sister said I should bill them for the money I lost, but I don't know if that would be appropriate. Should I apologize for springing it on them and explain I didn't mean to offend them? We just feel like it would've been inappropriate of us to expect our guests to spend a bunch of money on our wedding when we're fortunate enough to cover it. AITA?

As far as the close friend from college and her husband - sounds like they’re dealing with their own insecurities or had another reason to not attend (maybe needed the time off for something else or had a family issue and didn’t want to discuss so gave a bad excuse). None of it was due to you. 

You and your husband went above and beyond to create a memorable celebration and ensured your friends could attend to make it even more special. I’d lean toward don’t ask for money back, don’t apologize - if you want to keep her in your life maybe just consider her more of a periodic touch base friend vs the celebrate special moments ones.

OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:

 > 1) I directly stated that the father of my child is an atm after he expressed hurt in feeling that way since he’s not actively part of her life but I ask for financial help when we need it. 2) I was blunt and called a father an atm, am I cold for that? Is that wrong of me? I don’t care how he feels since he’s not involved by his own choice. 
Basically does it make it okay since it’s true or can it be true but I’m still an asshole for saying it? Am I letting my previous feelings towards him judge our current interaction

I was needing financial help with back to school shopping for my 6 year old after unexpectedly replacing my car clutch. I asked her bio dad, sending him an Amazon link. I’ve done this a few times over the years. A little background- I’m 25 but met him when I was 17, he was my boss, 32 years old at the time. He was going through a divorce and had 4 kids, I was a broken teen desperate for love. We started a relationship and when I tried breaking up with him at 18 he begged me to stay promising a family. I was desperate for love and a family so I stayed and he got me pregnant. It didn’t take me long to realize he would never change. He has substance abuse issues and well…He made me a step mommy at 17 years old. Anyways since then he was charged for the legal side of that and he hasn’t been around since she was 1. He pays court ordered support of $400/month. Anyways he said he would get to it but two weeks passed and with school about to start I reached out again just sending a cashapp request for school supplies and clothes. He lost it! He blew up my phone saying he would never give me cash and that he had bills. He went from 0 to 100. I said if he doesn’t want to help he should just say that instead of looking foolish lying. I keep tabs on him, he knows this, and he spent the entire summer traveling with his girlfriend going to music festivals and the night before he was drinking on a jetski. I told him being unable to help and not wanting to help are two different things. I said I tried doing this amicably asking him, communicating for the bare minimum on his part but if I need to request modification for the child support order that works too. He lost it more saying he hopes I do so he can apply to have our daughter in his life… I’d like to mention, child support orders and custody orders are two separate things, he just wanted to get a reaction from me. Anyways I stopped responding because I refuse to argue. Our daughter doesn’t know who he is and he’s never once asked to see her. Now this morning he sent screenshots of custody order papers with a text saying if I file to modify child support, he’ll submit those. He also made a comment about screenshotting our old text from years ago and what my boss would think about them. I told him his behavior is extremely gross. I called him out on attempting to intimidate my career. I told him not to worry about the school supplies and that if I knew asking for $200 from a 40 year old man to buy our child basic needs would cause him a tantrum I would’ve never asked. He realized I wasn’t going to fight him so he apologized and asked for an updated wishlist. I told him not to worry about it. He then apologized and said he just hates feeling like an ATM. I told him that’s what he is, an ATM. All parents are. I also repeated how gross his behavior is and that $400/ month is a joke. I said a lot, respectfully but in a way that hurt and he didn’t respond. So AITA? Him and his lady sure think so

OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:

 > So my mom, sister, brother-in-law and niece are staying over at my house tonight. Unfortunately, we do not have a pool gate around our pool. Its a rental property and they're supposed to install one eventually but have not yet. My mom always gets very paranoid about my niece trying to get outside and get into the pool alone. I dont think she would personally but she can be a little mischievous and is very independent, which can get her into trouble sometimes. We were figuring out ways to keep her from getting out, like putting chairs in front of the door so we'd hear if she tried getting out, when we asked her if she was supposed to go out alone and she said no. We then asked if she knew why and she said very monotone in a way that said ""I'm just repeating what I've been told a million times"" i could fall in adrown. I said to her ""you realize that drowning is one of the worst ways to die? Its terrible for everyone involved and it happens all the time to people of all ages, especially small children. It is so important to be careful around water and to never go in alone because anything could happen, even if you can swim."" My mom said ""ok, way to scare the crap out of her. Im going to hear about that when she tells me about her nightmares."" I told her she was paranoid about her getting out so she needs to know some ugly truths about serious consequences if she were to go out there alone. Admittedly, it probably was a bit blunt for a 7 year old but its very serious and dangerous if she goes out there alone. Partially I was trying to scare her enough to have a legit reason to listen because sometimes she just won't and I felt like it was the truth. So AITA for saying that? I should probably have worded it differently.


I think i might be the asshole because of the way my mom responded. It may have been harsh

My son liked to play with lighters. At 7. His ferternal grandfather let him flick his petrol lighter (won’t name the brand). I completely forgot I had a long nosed lighter I used for a coal fire back in the day. He found it and burnt a hole in a few things before I found out. A carrier bag gave him up. The smell. I was soooooo scared. The lighter was destroyed and to combat the ever wanting to play with fire I showed him two things. The fire services short film of how quickly a bedroom fire can take hold. And a photo or a burn victims arms. My son is in his early 30s now. He’s never even smoked a cigarette.

People have been scaring children to protect them for at least 10,000 years. 

When children can’t process that there is danger, they are at a higher risk of being hurt or killed. Your neice being so cavalier about water safety was a red flag that you addressed in an age appropriate manner.

Are your niece's parents concerned that she'll go to the pool when she's not supposed to? Or is this entirely you and your mom?

I totally get erring on the side of caution, so you're not really the AH either way, but I do question if it's necessary.

If you told my 7 year old ""don't go to the pool alone you could drown"" that's kind of all that needs to be said. My son is a rule follower in his heart of hearts. Anything above and beyond might very well scare him (I laid it on a bit thick about needing to hustle at a layover in the airport this summer and he was _wigging_ out we were going to miss the plane).

My 4 year old on the other hand, when she's 7 she'll almost certainly need that talk. Because even now you can't simply _tell_ her to do something you need to _persuade_ her it is indeed the right course of action (we are all cursed with a child like ourselves I guess). So with her that talk would make a ton of sense.

Not the AH either way, but unless you know your niece super well I'd follow the parents' lead in how best to handle their child.",43,2025-08-12 01:16:56,False,AITA telling my 7 year old niece that drowning is the worst way to die?,940,2025-08-12 00:40:46,277,,,,,,[]

Drowning is often silent. You’d think there’s splashing and commotion, but there isn’t. Most of the time it’s below the surface and when it’s done, it’s done. She needs to know about the very real threat to her life. She needs to understand that she absolutely cannot go out there.

So my mom, sister, brother-in-law and niece are staying over at my house tonight. Unfortunately, we do not have a pool gate around our pool. Its a rental property and they're supposed to install one eventually but have not yet. My mom always gets very paranoid about my niece trying to get outside and get into the pool alone. I dont think she would personally but she can be a little mischievous and is very independent, which can get her into trouble sometimes. We were figuring out ways to keep her from getting out, like putting chairs in front of the door so we'd hear if she tried getting out, when we asked her if she was supposed to go out alone and she said no. We then asked if she knew why and she said very monotone in a way that said ""I'm just repeating what I've been told a million times"" i could fall in adrown. I said to her ""you realize that drowning is one of the worst ways to die? Its terrible for everyone involved and it happens all the time to people of all ages, especially small children. It is so important to be careful around water and to never go in alone because anything could happen, even if you can swim."" My mom said ""ok, way to scare the crap out of her. Im going to hear about that when she tells me about her nightmares."" I told her she was paranoid about her getting out so she needs to know some ugly truths about serious consequences if she were to go out there alone. Admittedly, it probably was a bit blunt for a 7 year old but its very serious and dangerous if she goes out there alone. Partially I was trying to scare her enough to have a legit reason to listen because sometimes she just won't and I felt like it was the truth. So AITA for saying that? I should probably have worded it differently.

n8afok8,1mo2dzg,AmItheAsshole,Leading-Knowledge712,"Nta Your motives are good and could help prevent your niece from going into the water. I suggest you also get a pool alarm AND have the girl wear a wrist alarm that sounds if it gets wet. 

Also look into the possibility of installing gates to block access to the pool. For example, we have one that makes it very hard or impossible for kids to leave our deck while permitting adults to do so. If you have a burglar system, set it to signal if doors are opened as an added layer of protection.

Drowning is a leading cause of death in younger children so the more you can do to keep your niece safe, the better. Also consider getting in the landlord’s case about installing a fence. In many parts of the US, that is legally required. And even if it’s not required in your area, by installing one, your landlord would be helping prevent tragedies and expensive lawsuits.

Edit: Another important point is to assign an adult to supervise the child in the water. There have been cases when a child drowned while adults were present because no one was paying close attention to the child.

“Because I said so” parenting is lazy/neglectful at best and dangerous/deadly at worst. Based on your niece’s response to asking her if she understood why, it’s clear that she didn’t actually understand the consequences of going in the pool alone. She probably didn’t even understand what drowning was. And that is the fault of your sister who did not do her job as the parent and adequately teach the consequences if this rule were to be broken.

I’m sure your sister would much rather deal with her daughter having nightmares than losing her child.

I liked to do underwater flips at that time and tried one in the donut but got stuck upside down. I could NOT get out of the donut or right myself for what felt like forever and was running out of breath. I'm sure I was kicking like crazy but no one saved me, no one flipped me over, eventually I managed to swing my legs the right way to get myself flipped right side up. I got right out of the pool and that memory has stuck with me forever. I still get anxiety in situations where I have to hold my breath because those feelings flood back. 

NTA, it's way better for a kid to know the possible consequences of breaking a sensible highly important rule (no going in the pool alone) than deal with the consequences of the kid drowning. And an adult should always be monitoring the pool and all young swimmers, not distracted, doing their own thing and assuming others are watching. Even not alone, pools are dangerous.",9,2025-08-12 09:34:08,False,AITA telling my 7 year old niece that drowning is the worst way to die?,940,2025-08-12 00:40:46,277,,,,,,[]
n8bp44b,1mo2dzg,AmItheAsshole,a3wagner,"I had a similar experience at age 4. I was in my neighbour’s pool and I tried to walk to the deep end with a pool noodle, got flipped upside down and also saw the surface of the water as it got farther and farther away. Was rescued immediately, thankfully. 

I went on to take swimming lessons and when I was advanced enough to go to the deep end, I started bawling uncontrollably and didn’t know why. 

Turns out I had also almost drowned as a baby and didn’t remember that, but my soul did. I was 30 before I ever went into a deep end of a pool again.

There are WAY worse ways to learn about drowning than simply being told about it.

n8dyuzs,1mo2dzg,AmItheAsshole,SophisticatedScreams,"""Risky play"" is usually on a playground or field-- that term wouldn't be used for a street or a pool.


An example of appropriate risky play was that some kids found a wooden board and were using it to ""surf"" down a hill. Getting injured is a possibility, but the benefits (proprioception and exercise, plus learning how to manage your body on an unfamiliar surface) outweigh the risks.

n8aell6,1mo2dzg,AmItheAsshole,KaliTheBlaze,"Floating on the back requires quite a bit more physical effort (keeping muscles tense, holding the right position, and for lean people they may have to constantly paddle or kick lightly to stay afloat).  Unless you’ve got quite a bit of body fat and it’s distributed in exactly the right way, dead man’s float is a clear winner, and anyone teaching water survival will tell you the same.  Personally, I was a skinny child, so even though we had a large pool when I was little, I couldn’t float on my back for more than a couple minutes until well into puberty.  Around age 14-15 it got a lot easier because like most women, I grew boobs and hips, and it turns out that’s a fairly useful distribution of fat for floating.

The Navy teaches the dead man’s float for survival for primarily 3 reasons: it generally requires much less effort (which saves your energy reserves and lengthens your survival time), it’s so much more efficient that people can do it in full kit, and floating on the back is basically useless if there’s even a little chop/rough water,",5,2025-08-12 06:50:08,False,AITA telling my 7 year old niece that drowning is the worst way to die?,940,2025-08-12 00:40:46,277,,,,,,[]

n8ff21j,1mo2dzg,AmItheAsshole,KaliTheBlaze,"A dead man’s float still requires significantly less effort and can be sustained much longer for the vast majority of people, even in glass-still water.

But it’s really neither here nor there for OP - either floating technique relies on the person not panicking and immediately switching over to floating, and expecting a young child who is a weak, inexperienced swimmer to do that is going to end in tears.

Part of the problem with teaching a kid that they can save themselves that way is that it can create a feeling that they don’t need to exercise as much caution around the pool as they ought.  Both my sister and I came close to drowning as children because we felt safer than we should have around a pool. I tried to squeeze through a narrow spot between the house and the pool and fell in, fortunately right as my mother looked out to check that I was playing where I was supposed to be (obviously I wasn’t - I wasn’t supposed to leave the raised patio that stopped a good 6’ from the edge of the pool, and I was right at the edge of the pool when I fell).  My sister decided to step back into the pool without her water wings during a family party, and my uncles who were supposed to be watching the kids in the pool got a little too into their conversation about a car engine.  She nearly drowned within arm’s reach of them, but my aunt looked over at the pool at the right moment.

Because it sounds like that's what you were offering him (kind of watching his thing, swapping between watching and being on the phone)

For you, watching his baseball thing was about spending time with him, being in his space.

So it's understandable that you feel hurt that he doesn't want to return the favour of ""proximal intimacy""

I'm guessing he doesn't understand that the goal of him watching something with you is not to force himself to enjoy FNAF, but rather to find ways to enjoy being in each other's space while having fun.

Playing animal crossing on the switch sat on the couch next to a partner who's watching their musical could have been the compromise, but he didn't really understand what the goal of the interaction was.

So my boyfriend put on a youtube video that was almost 2 hours long (backyard baseball?) while us and my parents were eating dinner. I watched part of it, and then went on my phone, and then would go back and forth while it was on. After it finished, i asked for the remote to turn my video on (it was fnaf the musical). He then sat there and went “im not watching this” and was trying to get up. I was jokingly holding him down because i didnt want him to get up. Once he got up he said “i dont want to watch this, i want to play animal crossing im going upstairs”. I obv got upset because i willingly sat there and watched his thing, so i was hoping/expecting him to watch mine (which imo is the nice thing to do). He’s trying to tell me i’m being selfish and im not rightfully upset because he shouldnt have to sit there and watch my thing even if i sat there and watched his bc he “dodnt make me and no one was forcing me”. I also told him i was upset he didnt come up with a compromise to watch it later if he didnt want to watch it, but he said he “didnt have to and i need to grow up.” Am i being unreasonable for expecting the same kind behaviour back or no?

n8fd2j0,1mou876,AmItheAsshole,WonderfulConflict803,"This is a silly thing… communication. But also why is this even an issue? It’s not like you paid money for it at a movie house. I do believe in treating others as you want to be treated, but this one isn’t worth an argument IMO going forward you can discuss what you want to watch together and find a show you both like.

Example, my husband loves war and history movies - which I watch with him (tho I find it boring it doesn’t take away from me, sometimes I learn something), but I like cartoons and rom coms which he usually won’t watch with me, if it’s something I am excited about I will ask and then he will watch it with me cause I asked and he will usually like it. See communication it works… what we both enjoy is usually movies and shows I introduced to him cause I now know what he likes and I find shows I like with it (action, action is the exciting thing) I find action comedies and we both happy.

Side note I started watching the boys cause it was interesting but it got too gross for me but then he was into it and then he kept reminding me it was my choice and we must finish what we start… 🤣

n8fhag9,1mou876,AmItheAsshole,Daymjoo,"You've accidentally stumbled on one of the biggest issues not just in couple life but in human interactions in general. It's a very complex issue with no clear solution. 

You give because you care about someone and want them to appreciate you. They appreciate you, but don't want to give the same thing back because different things have different values to different people (i.e. he cares far less about you watching his thing than you care about him watching your thing, but he'll care more about other stuff than you). This breeds resentment in you, and frustration in your partner, and the relationship therefore deteriorates. 

There's no good answer to this, it is a relationship dynamic issue which requires constant compromise and readjustment. It's not a matter of you needing to grow up, it's a matter of both of you needing to become emotionally mature to the point of being able to comprehend this relatively complex aspect of relationship dynamics. Navigating it is difficult.

I would be calling you the ""TP Police"" from now on - that would be your new nickname.  

Toilet paper is NOT an option and you are not qualified to tell other people how many squares of tp THEY need per wipe.  ""...it will have to last"" is a moronic concept.  

>  I didn't know it was needed a week ago or forgot 

Do you have eyes to go take a look?  So which is it you didn't know or your forgot?

If it's your turn to buy the toilet paper, buy the damned toilet paper.

The constant attempt by them makes me think this is an issue with you because 7 rolls doesn't require an immediate response.  Is this a habitual failure on your part and them nagging a response to that?",3,2025-08-12 22:58:27,False,"AITA: Roommate Kept Badgering Me And Lectured Me About ""Financial Responsibility"" Over TP",22,2025-08-12 21:19:42,54,,,,,,[]

I live with my partner (M) and a roommate (R) for a solid year now we've agreed to split the bill on some common/shared things like condiments, toilet paper and such. Everything has been ( up until this point ) fairly smooth sailing. I live on a VERY finite income ( 900 + whatever I can scare up in commissions w/ freelance drawing )

  
Today M brought to my attention that we're running low on TP (7 rolls), asks me what the plan is. My answer: ""I don't know, it'll have to last for now"" as I don't have an answer at the moment and am trying to get some work done.

  
R decides to jump in to the conversation and tells me that they bought the TP last time and similarly wants to know what the plan is. My answer is the same: ""I don't know, it will have to last"". R then repeats the query, I give R the same answer and add ""I don't know what you want from me."" ( a explicit hint: Leave me alone please )

  
R continues to repeat the question ad nauseum and my answer is largely the same. A break in the conversation so I decide to get back to work, R takes this as ignoring them and not as a hint to leave me alone so I can work ( it's pretty obvious I'm working ) and decides to lecture me about my finances, asking me why I didn't buy TP a week ago ( answer: I didn't know it was needed a week ago or forgot ) when I ordered groceries and telling me that the other grocery purchases I made were not necessary; telling me I had an obligation to buy TP and failed, then again, continues to repeat the query ""What is the plan"".

  
If it matters but I buy good TP and thus: only need 4 squares per wipe and yet we seem to go through a whole roll a day when I can make a single roll last near a month. I feel like if I had been given more than 3 seconds to think at a time, I could have come up with a solution but R wanted an answer right then and there and was going to continue badgering me until I either gave R what he wanted to hear or lost my temper. I don't know.

Your hobby is real-time games.  You can't just drop in the middle.  She should understand that.

She has hobbies too.  How would she react to you interrupting her voice lesson to talk about some recent success or issue?  She seems OK interrupting you, and it's possible that's just how she was raised.

The real issue here is one of respect.  She doesn't respect your use of time.

If you can't leave the game immediately, on one occassion or multiple, that's just the way it goes.

Now, my opinion can change if she's in the middle of something and you interrupted her, and she tells you to wait until she's finished or abruptly stops whatever she's doing to cater to your beck and call.

To me it seems like more so a ""she's not pleased with having to wait a few minutes"" after interrupting your gaming.

With that said, I've been in the same situation multiple times, when I'm actively not doing anything of importance to me, I'm never asked to do anything...but when I'm actively involved in anything that needs my undivided attention, catastrophe strikes and it can't wait 10-15 minutes.

I mean, come on...she was gone *for almost a week*, and you blew her off as soon as she returned?  You couldn't even be bothered to get up to welcome her home because you were gaming?  YTA for that alone; you'd have to work pretty hard to send a louder ""you aren't that important to me"" message.   

When my spouse is absent for any significant time (even just an overnight stay), I'm almost always in the driveway to meet-and-greet her, carry her bags inside when she returns, and do a few minutes of catching up; back when I did a lot of business travel, she'd be waiting up for my return, just so we could talk for a few minutes.   We do the same sort of things today, even when it's just a few minutes to catch up after one of us has been doing something outside our normal routine.  That's just part of, you know, sharing lives.

Given that you have two examples in just the last few weeks, I think it's probably happening more often than you realize.  I think you need to consider how often she may be putting other things off (that you don't see) because she sees/knows that you're gaming.

Gaming sounds like this is the only thing you can get away with this on because you can't ""pause.""  Lets be honest, if it were any other activity, it sounds ridiculous. 

At the end of the day, it doesn't matter if your an asshole or not.  Inquire more with your wife about how she feels and the emotion *underneath* the emotion of annoyance, like abandonment or her feeling ignored, and how to better address that, even if you leave some room for gaming.

n8blj1j,1mo8spv,AmItheAsshole,chiarakix,"YTA — “micro-connetctions“ like these are what keep a relationship alive  
  
I get it, when you’re locked in on something, whether it’s gaming, reading, or watching a show, it can be frustrating to just stop on command. And if it’s happening every few minutes, that’s definitely annoying.

But that doesn’t sound like what’s going on here. From what you’ve described, it seems like this only happens on occacions, when she just wants to share something that’s overly exciting to her in the moment. That’s normal. It’s a sign of love. It’s only natural to want to share those little bursts of joy with the person you love.

We call these moments “micro-connections.” Love is made up of them. Those tiny moments — a good morning text, a goodbye kiss or even a “Hey, look! There are Cows!” — are what feed a bond and keep two people connected. They keep the love warm and alive.

Dismissing her for an online game in those moments is a bad look and can damage the relationship in the long run. From her pov this can over time create a feeling of you losing interest in her. It might sound dramatic, but if it happens repeatedly, those little rejections add up. 

By being more present and intentional in these moments, you'll boost both your moods, reduce stress, and build trust and intimacy.",0,2025-08-12 10:25:23,False,AITA for not leaving my online game?,294,2025-08-12 06:30:27,304,,,,,,[]

Yesterday, I was playing Apex while my wife was having a voice lesson for about an hour. When she was finished, she was excited to talk to me about her lesson. I was in the middle of an online match with about 5 minutes left. I asked her to wait until the game was over, and then we could talk. She got upset and called her friend instead.

She told me that she felt I had plenty of time to play games and that her happiness shouldn’t have to be “on hold.” My view is that waiting a few minutes to let me finish an online match seems reasonable. If it was a single-player game, I could just pause it. So she spends the rest of the evening in a poor mood, and we hardly talk to each other.

This isn't the first time we've had this issue. A few weeks ago, she was at a choir camp for almost a week. When she came home, I happened to be playing a game. She wanted me to come outside right away to see her garden’s progress. I asked her to wait until my game was done, but she said I had three seconds before she’d get mad. I closed the game and went outside, but she was still in a bad mood afterward and told me a lot of things she felt I was doing wrong.

AITA for asking for a few minutes to finish my games before giving her my attention?

She should try to have a little more patience, sure, but my guy... come on. This is why people look down on adults playing video games, because adult ""gamers"" think it's a life and death choice when confronted with turning off the game.


Maybe this is just me, but it takes very little effort to show your partner that they are a priority to you. If you're constantly choosing videogames over her sharing her thoughts and life with you, you need to have a conversation about your expectations of her during game time, while giving her the space to share her expectations of you and how you show her attention and affection. If those don't line up and you can't or won't compromise, thats something you need to figure out.


I guess ultimately you need to figure out what actually matters to you. Is ""5/10/15 more minutes"" of a damn video game more important than the wedge it's obviously driving between you two, or can you put yourself in her shoes to realize that to you, sure, it's just a few minutes, but to her it may feel like she doesn't matter as much to you?

Both of you need to adjust expectations and communicate.  When you are gaming, I would let her know or text her if she is out - ""I'm playing Dead by Daylight with some people - give me a heads up when you're on the way back so I can finish out my game around the time you arrive home.""

If she's not asking often, would it really be so bad to ditch a multiplayer game every once in a while?

I'm only wondering because one of your examples is right after she came home after a week away. Did you greet her and then go back to gaming and then she wanted you to come outside and see her garden or whatever, or were you gaming when she came home and decided finishing that was more important than greeting her after she was away?

If she's only asking you to immediately get off your game occasionally, she could be asking because she really needs you to give her attention in that moment in order to feel cared about. Have you talked about it at all? Gaming takes a lot of your attention, there could be other behaviors while you're playing that are making her feel ignored that you don't really notice you're doing because you're focused.

I'm not saying either of you is right or wrong. But it kind of seems like you just want a way to make her understand that you can't leave your game whenever. Except that's not going to work because you could. Like if there was a fire or if you suddenly had to puke or if there was a cockroach on your desk or you suddenly spilled something and it was gonna ruin your computer, you'd probably give up on the game in at least one of those scenarios to deal with the situation. She knows that you technically can stop playing whenever you want.

I get that you can't put down whatever you're doing whenever she wants you, but is that actually what she's asking?

Hello, so my dad has a friend (let's call her J) who is living in our home, and my dad recently paid a bunch of money to put on a home security system. 

When the system is on, any window / door that gets open or broken into will set off an alarm, and will notify me and my dad through our phones, and may notify the police (my memory on that is a bit blurred). This means that if me or my dad leave the house and turn on the security system (using a square button that goes with a key chain), and no one is home, and J arrives home but doesn't turn off the security system before entering, the alarm system will go off  and send a scare to me and my dad. 

And if J also doesn't turn on the alarm system before leaving, and someone breaks into the home, guess what? No one will know. Because J refuses to put on the alarm system.

J has vehemently told me and my dad that she doesn't want to take on the responsibility of turning on / off the alarm system, and says it's not good for her car keys (because it can make her keys be too heavy for the car). She thinks IATA for trying to impose upon her to carry and use the security button.

I quite frankly think that J is being selfish. Since now we can't actually use the security system, because J doesn't want to handle a little inconvenience / responsibility. To me, it is the equivalent of refusing to lock the door before leaving the house.

My dad keeps telling me that he will talk to her to convince her, but I think he is getting too tired of conflict (he is approaching his 80's). 

So AITA? Or is J the asshole? And how should we resolve this?

Asking a resident, even a temporary one to arm the system before leaving is just sensible home protection to me.  If J can't follow a simple request, then maybe she needs to find a new place to live.

We don't have a home alarm system, bc we're on the back of a property, and the people at the front have cameras trained on their front garden/street, and the driveway.  Is it naive of us?  Perhaps, but we live in a low-crime area, where the worst that's happened is a couple of car break ins where the cars were on the street.  Compared to our last home, where the neighbours diagonally down the street were known to everyone on the street as well as the cops for frequent loud, violent, domestics.

Last thanksgiving, I (19f) made a joke saying I looked pregnant after eating too much since I was bloated. I made this joke in front of my sister (34f), not thinking anything of it. My sister got her son taken away 12 years ago, and has since had to have a hysterectomy for medical reasons. Because of her felonies, she’s not allowed to adopt, so she has no chance of being a mother. Tensions are high during Thanksgiving, especially in the South, so I apologized and went about my holiday, because it was rather insensitive. However, this February, I was involved in a car accident that rendered me incapable of pregnancy. While a child is NOT something I need right now considering my school, finances, age, etc, I am very sad that later on when I may want one, I will not be able to as I have felonies as well. I’ve been struggling with PTSD from the accident and have been in very intense therapy, but I reached out to my sister for extra support since she’s been in a similar situation. After explaining how I feel, all she said was “You kind of know how it feels then LOL.” A child isn’t something I want, but the injury was serious and I’m still recovering, so hearing that made me feel selfish for even reaching out for help. I’m not sure if I should give her more grace considering her son turned 15 yesterday so she may just be going through a hard time or if I should feel a little aggravated that she made my trauma about herself.

You made a joke, a common one, not to purposely set her off, but just at your own expense. She called you out on it, you both moved on (as I read it).

Now you're in a position where you understand a little more now about her feelings especially around being able to have kids in future and you can see why the joke stung her a bit.  She herself is probably realising now, as she's getting older, and maturing, that she regrets her actions that lead her to have her kid taken away.  

Is she TA for snapping at you? Maybe? Are you TA for reaching out to her now? Maybe?   But on the whole, I think your family could do with some counselling and healing.",-1,2025-08-12 22:31:23,False,AITA for making a joke about me being overweight?,55,2025-08-12 14:56:54,43,,,,,,[]

This summer we had two weddings one from my mom’s side of the family, and one from my dad’s side. Both were close cousins of mine.
Last year, the mother of the bride on my mom’s side told someone that if I attended her daughter’s engagement party with my husband (who is Black), she would throw me out because she didn’t want anyone Black there. I heard about it and decided to cut off all contact with them.
Fast forward to this year she invited my whole family, including me, to the wedding. But she made it clear I could not bring my husband or my daughter (even though other kids would be there). Obviously, I said I wouldn’t go, even if my husband were invited. My sisters, brother, and dad all declined to go too.
But my mom decided to go and then had the nerve to get mad at me, saying it was my fault the rest of the family wasn’t attending. The wedding passed, and no one cared.
Now for the second wedding  my cousin from my dad’s side lost both her parents in a car accident when she was 16. She’s getting married now. My mom refuses to attend because my cousin didn’t publicly thank her for helping raise her and her brother.
The rest of my family, including me, is attending. My dress was custom-made, and when I tried it on, I noticed burn holes in it. My mom is the only one who smokes, so I’m certain she did it. She then told me, “If you didn’t attend my family’s wedding, you’re not going to this one either.”
I went off on her  told her she always has to be the center of attention, she would choose her side of the family over me in a heartbeat, and that she constantly causes drama and destroys relationships. She replied, “Well, you shouldn’t have married a man like you did.”
That’s when I told her I don’t want her in my or my daughter’s life anymore because all she does is create chaos and hurt people.

Now I’m wondering… did I go too far?

My (27F) friend (27F) from graduate school is getting married this fall!! I am so excited to attend the wedding and just celebrated with her at her bachelorette party last weekend. I realized, however, that her bridal shower is the same day as Lorde's concert in Chicago (only date of this tour that I am able to attend sadly). I have not RSVP'd to the shower yet, but nor have I actually purchased the tickets yet - waiting/praying for re-sale prices to go down since I was unsuccessful in the ticketmaster war, boo. I feel like missing a bridal shower is not as big of a deal (especially since I have attended her bachelorette party already and will 100% be there on her wedding day). I am not actually in her wedding party (just a close \[i guess?\] friend and guest). Plus Lorde/Ella has raised me - I am convinced that I would not be who i am today without her music tbh.... A mutual friend of ours thinks it is very rude to even consider going to a concert instead of to our friend's shower for her big day... SO aita for wanting to sob to Ribs live instead of going to my friend's bridal shower?? lmk and pls be nice - i wish i was joking about this, it's an actual moral dilemma to me !

You will probably change your personal style many, many times throughout your life.

You're 16. Right now is the perfect age to experiment and find out what makes you feel good!

As long as it isn't permanently altering your appearance (e.g. tattoos, facial piercings), I say go for it.

You're lucky that you have the chance to experiment. I'm old enough to be your grandma, and I went to a school with a uniform and *extremely* prescriptive rules about hair. ""No extreme styles or colors, anything below collar length must be tied back, no adornments except ribbons which must be navy blue, and bobby pins must match hair color."" Not much scope for experimentation there! (We weren't allowed to wear makeup or jewelry either.)

I look back on it all and I still find it hard to understand my school's obsession with this trivia. For heaven's sake, as long as your hair is clean and not falling in your face, does the rest really matter?

Similarly, I find your dad's obsession with your hair color a bit strange, given that you're only a teenager.

He MAY have a point with regard to the conservatism of the legal profession where you live. (I emphasize ""may"". Not ""definitely"".) If you think they really are that conservative, it wouldn't hurt to acknowledge his point, because he may feel that you're not listening to him. Sometimes people just want to know that you've heard them and you've thought about what they said, even if you ultimately decide not to take their advice.

Something like this:

""Dad, I hear you. You're worried that if I keep dying my hair, I'm going to find it hard to get work as an attorney. I appreciate your concern. I'm glad you're looking out for me. But a law career is almost 10 years away! I'm not even old enough for college yet! If I really will have to adopt a conservative style once I start out on a law career, I'd like to have my wild and crazy phase now, while I still can, and get it out of my system. I promise you I won't do anything to damage my hair or permanently alter the way I look. I know you're not going to like every hairstyle or color I try, but do you think you can limit your criticism to just rolling your eyes and muttering that kids today have terrible taste, or something?""",14,2025-08-12 17:24:17,False,AITA for dying my hair even though my dad doesn’t agree?,31,2025-08-12 16:26:54,51,,,,,,[]

So, I (16F) have been dying my hair for about 3 years. I love it, it makes me feel like me. My parents however, mostly my dad, do not like my hair being unnatural. My natural color is blonde and thats how he wishes it would stay. He already doesn’t agree with the way I dress, that being grunge, and thinks I need to dress more girly and preppy.

Anyways, I had bleached my hair back to blonde to please my parents before school started and it lasted a good 5 weeks before I started feeling uneasy every time I looked in the mirror. I did not like the blonde. I texted my dad and he told me that jobs wont take me with dyed hair and I counter it with the jobs im currently looking at don’t care (retail). He never replied and he picked me up later that day. 

We go to the store and I start browsing hair dyes, I wanted dark red, he sees me and visibly gets upset, but he buys it for me anyway. We get to the car and I apologize for the price of the hair dye and he tells me, “It isn’t about the hair dye”  and goes on to say that the career I want (an attorney- but thats way down the line) is going to look at me and turn me away. He’s a judge, and he said that at work, he tells his buddys what I want to be and they tell him I can come work for them later on, but they aren’t going to want me because of my hair being all sorts of colors.  I tell him then maybe they aren’t for be and he gets pretty upset. He tells me that I need to conform to them and that I can’t just say something is not for me. He yells a bit more but I just ignore it. I didn’t say anything back and there’s a bit of silence before he says I wont find whatever I’m looking for in a box of hair dye. We get home and I go to my room. I dye my hair, go to the kitchen and he yells at me again about “conforming”.

I feel like he’s embarrassed about me. I know he doesn’t like not having a girly daughter, like when I was a kid, but I wish he’d understand that my hair isn’t going to be like this in the future and I just want to have fun now. AITA?

n8e65bl,1mooik6,AmItheAsshole,ClaireL58,"NTA. Like others have said, and I will echo, now is such a great time for you to have fun with your hair. 

I assume you’re getting decent hair dye that isn’t as damaging and will wash out eventually? That’s honestly the only thing I’m ‘worried’ about for you haha. Don’t want to damage your hair too much! 

Have fun while you can. I didn’t become a serious lawyer, but you’d be surprised at how many businesses simply do not care. 

I never experimented with my hair until like 2020, and I am a full grown adult, with a big-woman job. It’s so much fun. 

I’ve gone light pinks, darker pinks, Cheeto orange, peachy, etc. All of the jobs I’ve had since then, have simply not cared. In fact, my bosses have loved what I show up in and I’ve had jobs ranging from simple sales to more professional (like a doctor’s office). 

My hair truly did not impact my work ethic negatively and clients were cool about it. I’ve worked at places where people come in with so much pain, some being kids. I think fun colors brings some happiness into the place. That its not scary.

College is the PERFECT time for something like a tongue piercing. 

That’s the thing though, my parents knew that too. They were hoping it wouldn’t occur to me. They wanted me to never get it pierced and were just stalling as long as possible.

OK so I bought this plot of land in a remote village in the mountains with a house, and I kept adding  more and more land to it.  
The main plot has an old house on it which we invested quite a bit in to make livable and modern. Next to it there's an empty plot which I was told had no owned, and after that there's another plot with an old unlived in house.  
For the past 3 years I tried to buy the empty plot next to me. I had been told that the owner had died long ago with no heir. Like 40 years ago.  
At the village hall I was told nobody knew who the owner was because the old owner died in 1985 without kids.  
My plan was to buy the plot next to us and the one next to it and make a very large yard for our animals( we rescue dogs and cats).

Eventually we found out the old owner had a distant relative, who came in and did the paperwork to put the empty plot in his name. I asked him if he was wiling to sell it, I offered him a lot of money, more than double the normal price. he refused. I found out he wanted to build a house for his son there.

So I went ahead and bought the third plot, the one on the other side of his plot, fr the purpose of putting our farm animals there as that one has a paddock and a barn.

We like to grow our own food - what started as a holiday home project has now evolved into a hobby farm. We own the land at the back of all the house plots. So  We bought the other house plot,  built a proper fence and unified it at the back with the rest of our land.

 We put our pigs and cow in the third plot's barn, because, wel, pigs smell.

The owner of the middle plot came by this week- he lives in the city some 80 km away. When he saw we bought the third plot and we had basically enclosed his property he went hysterical, started to scream and threaten.  
 He claimed we only bought the third plot to enclose him and stop him from building his house.  It has caused a lot of rumours, he went to even complain to the village hall. We didn't do anything illegal, but some people in the village are on his side adthe atmosphere has become a little tense.  
INFO: his plot is some half a acre, he has room to build a house and make a garden.

First time making a post so be patient with me.

Hi (22F)! Im currently in a situation where I'm living with my (22F)partner their mom and older sister. I came up to live with them due to waiting to hear back on a job that went on hiring freeze shortly after I moved in. I have a decent enough job now but its hard when I'm the only person who has a job out of a house of 4. My partner quit their job due to scheduling putting them on Morning shifts. (They just hate waking up in the morning) we have had multiple conversations about them getting one and me having to repeatedly ask them if they put an application in somewhere.(They said they forgot or simply were afraid they'll say no). One day when I just got off a double shift I came home to see them sitting there on my laptop, complaining about how she didn't eat and there wasn't anything for us to eat..at that I blew up and told them to hurry up and get a job or I'm leaving. 


Extra Info: Their mom has disability checks come in once a month that goes straight to bills and cigarettes for her and the older sister.

I (34f) have been living in hotels and with an ex partner for the last 4 months because my apartment tested positive for mold, which I'm highly reactive/allergic to. At the same time, my 5 year old dog suddenly became severely ill. Her x-rays showed alarming inflammation in her lungs and overnight she was struggling to breathe. I packed a suitcase and left immediately thinking the mold was affecting her also. My plan was to find another place to stay while our landlord remediated the house. 

Devastatingly, only 2.5 weeks later my dog passed away. Her passing was extremely traumatic for me, but I will omit those details. I was in a very, very dark place. Not only did I lose my bestfriend and was living out of a suitcase, I also found out some unfortunate news regarding my own health, all the while being unemployed and living on savings and some generous help from my ex partner.

The night my girl passed away, my ex insisted I move into the extra bedroom of his apartment so I wouldn't grieve alone. He assured me that I could stay for as long as I needed to get back on my feet as well my house to be safe again. We get along super well, and I'm so grateful for his help. 

The whole time I've been here, both of my roommates have been constantly asking when I was coming back. Mind you, I've been paying my $2,200 rent plus utilities this whole time. (I live in SF, lol.) My answer has always been the same: I'm not coming back until the house is remediated. Unfortunately something was delaying the process of it all. 

Last week, I finally decided that I no longer wanted to pay rent for a place that I wasn't living in, especially because I was still unemployed. I knew the timing of my notice was less than ideal because my roommate ""Kate"" (46f), who is the master tenant and responsible for finding a replacement tenant, is in the throws of planning her wedding, amongst other things like talking to a surrogacy agency and immigration for her fiance, and I feel awful. I knew that she wasn't going to take the news well, but her reaction was far more unexpected than I thought.

When I told her I was moving out (7 week notice) she said that the timing didn't work for her and that I was being unkind. She threatened to keep my deposit if I didn't push my move out date by another month. When I told her that was illegal she started to freak out and told me that our friendship would be over. I was in shock. She said ""you knew about the wedding for months!"", but I honestly didn't have the mental clarity to make that big of a decision until very recently. I told her as soon as I knew. 

I can't help but feel horrible and guilty, but all my friends are telling me 7 weeks is more than fair and she is the one being a bad friend. I just have no idea because they are obviously biased. I'm just so tired of being a people pleaser and I would essentially lose over $2k to make it convenient for her. AITAH if I don't push my move out date by another month?

n88br7y,1mnsbjr,AmItheAsshole,FluffyProtection583,"I’m so sorry to hear about your dog, that’s heartbreaking. A few things:
- you should absolutely not be paying rent for a place you medically can’t live in. Period. This is very unusual and not standard. You almost certainly can and SHOULD get compensated for the rent you’ve paid since finding the mould issue. 
- your roommate is not your friend. She’s being selfish, unlawful, and cold hearted. Her request is actually in ‘ridiculous and absurd’ territory. I can’t believe she even had the audacity to ask that of you. Her lack of empathy towards you actually sounds a bit sociopathic. You’re probably giving too much notice already and could save yourself another month of rent by leaving earlier (assuming you only need 1 months notice as per your agreement). Leave as soon as possible and cut ties with her. Pursue her legally if she holds your deposit. You’ll win. 
- you’re ABSOLUTELY NTA. Not even close. I’m a people pleaser by nature and empathise with how hard conflict can feel, I struggle with it myself. But please know as a fact - this situation is not normal. Your roommate is not normal. It’s not normal that you’ve been paying rent for months when you can’t even live there. You’re owed lots of money, if you have the energy for it you absolutely should seek compensation. You’ve been wronged in this situation on so many points and need to advocate for yourself because everyone else is doing that for themselves (landlord, roommate). The difference is, that you’re in the right - legally and morally. 

I just wanted to emphasise that last point because I sense a lot of self doubt which is hard to read in a situation where you’re so clearly being screwed over. Not criticising you by the way - I also struggle with wanting to please people and find conflict very anxiety inducing. But if you bend to your roommate’s will, you would be massively letting yourself down. Please don’t forget you are also a person - ‘people please’ to yourself before others.

Weddings can turn people into the monsters they truly are hidden inside. You deserve better friends, especially after losing your pup.

n88qbms,1mo035e,AmItheAsshole,Letters_from_summer,"Edited for judgement:


YTA.


I've gone through and read your follow up comments. Look, you don't seem to be knowledgeable on your HVAC systems and best practices for the south. Your HVAC, unless it is a very cheap system, or insanely old, has a built in dehumidifier. When the AC I running it is removing humidity from the air. 66% indoor humidity is high. You definitely need to get an additional dehumidifier in the house or run your system longer. 


YTA because youve stated your girlfriend is getting up several hours every night after youve gone to sleep together to change the thermostat because she is literally not sleeping. You are sleep depriving her so you can save a few bucks and not taking any real steps to ensure her health and safety. That's a bad partner. There are numerous deflectors and other solutions you can use on your ceilings to impact the temperature in your office. I too have high ceilings. I too manage rooms that cool more efficiently than others. And sometimes I just put on a freaking sweatshirt for an hour because an hour of being chilly is better than 8 hours of tossing and turning because I cant sleep.


*I now return your to my original posted response* 




I literally gasped at the temperature you keep the house during the day and for sleeping. 


Look I hate, HATE, being cold, so I feel you on that sitting in side in the morning with the AC blowing on you. Its why I work outside in the summer. Is it great for my computer? No. Does it make me happy in the 90 degrees and at humidity levels my weather app says are dangerous? Yes. I may be part lizard.


That said, I cannot sleep unless my room is cold. The optimal temperature for sleep is 65 degrees. It was science. I read the study a few years back and now I will fight anyone who touches my thermostat because it really does make a difference. 


If you are keeping the thermostat at 74 during the day, what is your house actually cooling to? When are you turning the thermostat down to 68? It takes HOURS to bring the house down to that 68 level. If you are switching it at bedtime it isn't getting cool in time for sleep. I would honestly be contemplating ways to murder you while I'm not sleeping in the hotbox you call a bedroom. 


Do you have a thermometer in the bedroom? Can you confirm what temperature the room is getting down to at night with the window AC? I'm with your girlfriend on the fan. It makes me sick, also, it doesn't cool anything, it just moves around the air at the current temp.


You said you are doing this to save money. Have you run the difference on the cost of the AC window unit verses running the central AC? The window units are notorious energy sucks in addition to screwing up your homes energy efficiency by messing up the insulation. You may be paying more to not cool your room properly.


Have to tried closing the vent in your office over night and until the AC is returned to 74? That would keep your office from being cold while also allowing your girlfriend to sleep. Depending on your system that may also redirect some of that cold air into the bedroom. ",2057,2025-08-11 22:43:44,False,AITA not letting my girlfriend lower the temperature in our home any further?,828,2025-08-11 22:19:35,827,,,,,,[]
n88r034,1mo035e,AmItheAsshole,Duncan_sucks,"NTA. This is a legitimate reason to sleep in separate rooms by the way.

If she's blasting the A/C so she can bundle up in a heavy blanket with flannel pajamas and bedding, she needs to change her sleep habits. I know people that like to do that but if she's not paying the energy bill then that's not right.

If she's practically naked and sweating, maybe it's some sort of health issue?

Do the two of you cuddle the entire night? She could also be blasting the A/C because you're actually a human furnace and she likes to cuddle but she's also not able to sleep next to a furnace.

n89tulz,1mo035e,AmItheAsshole,dsp_guy,"I live in the Southeast US.  I'm well aware of what it is like here.  My wife and I have similar discussions about the AC temperature.  While I might ""pay the bills around here"" if someone is uncomfortable due to the temperature, it can be hard thing to deal with.  

68° just really isn't feasible.  My electric bill is pretty damn high already.

You’re both right and you’re both wrong at the same time.  If the central air is keeping the room around 70, the window unit probably isn’t actually doing very much because it thinks the room is cool enough already.  It’s sitting there with the fan on, but that’s it.  I don’t have central AC right now, just a window unit, and my room has a noticeable temperature swing around 4AM - at the coolest part of the night, with no sun load, my room warms up a bit - still cool, but warm enough to sweat me out of my light blanket.  Around 7AM as the sun comes up, the AC works just a bit harder, and will freeze me out of bed.

OP is right that cooling the whole house is wasting a lot of electricity, and his wife is right that the window unit isn’t helping enough.

When the air conditioner is in cooling mode, it’s blowing the air out. Maybe she just needs air movement from the vent?

Whatever you're accustomed to, your physiology adapts to. So it is grossly wasteful in hot seasons to acclimatise your body to cold weather temperatures and compensate again with sweaters and a thick comforter.

n8aw8yb,1mo035e,AmItheAsshole,AssiduousLayabout,"NAH - I also love sleeping in a cold bedroom, it's one of the few things that helps my terrible insomnia, but you also have a fair point on energy costs.

One thing you may want to look at for utility costs is if your utility company offers any time-of-use billing plans.

For myself, I pay about 50% more for electricity between 7 AM and 7 PM Monday through Friday (where I spend the majority of my time at work anyway) and in exchange, I get about a 40% discount on energy from 7 PM to 7 AM plus weekends.

This means my air conditioning is programmed to turn on at 7:15 PM and by 6 AM it effectively turns off (I keep it set to 85 just in case it's ridiculously hot out, but the house rarely ever warms to that level before 7:15 PM when it cools again). It's actually beneficial for me to get the house quite cool overnight (which I like anyway) because it means it stays comfortable for longer during the middle of the day and it's not too terrible when I get home from work. I have natural gas heating so I don't need to worry very much about when I heat the house in winter.

In addition to saving a lot of money by managing the timing for large electricity usage like A/C or charging my EV, this time-of-use billing plan makes my rooftop solar power even better - I get paid at higher rates when I sell electricity to the grid during the day, and buy it back at night for lower rates. That significantly improves the ROI on my investment in the panels.",1,2025-08-12 08:21:09,False,AITA not letting my girlfriend lower the temperature in our home any further?,828,2025-08-11 22:19:35,827,,,,,,[]

n8axo0y,1mo035e,AmItheAsshole,gildedmuse42,"This isn't going to be popular, but is there a reason she needs to be so cold? 

I asked because I have kidney pain, and when I get hot, it makes the pain that much harder to deal with and usually ends up with me vomiting, not from nausea. I don't even have to have anything in my stomach; it will just come up yellow. Especially at night when I'm trying to rest; having to live in heat honestly causes me physical pain.

In my case I'm not married, so I just have a window AC unit, and when I'm living with friends or roommates, I explain the situation, and I pay the extra. When my illness is so bad that I have to stay with my family, I'm lucky that they understand and allow me to have my window unit just as long as I turn it off anytime I'm not in the room (which I get doesn't sound like a big ask, but it does mean that if I come back from doing any sort of physical work or just the pain has randomly kicked up, I have to wait maybe 30 minutes before I can get comfortable, usually with me spread out as much as I can on the floor, just weeping and vomiting until the worst of the pain passes).

Now, it doesn't sound like anything this major is happening in this case, as it feels like it would have been mentioned, but a lot of people can be heat sensitive, which can lead to pain and vomiting. It's unlikely, but there's a small chance that your girlfriend is just very sensitive to heat, and being in even 70° can lead to her feeling physically sick. Though if this is happening without any underlining medical condition, I would actually worry about either her being pregnant or possibly having endometriosis or some sort of undiagnosed cause of pain because I've never heard of somebody who's had that big of a sensitivity towards heat that doesn't have some underlying condition that the heat is making worse. 

In that case just buy some really good ice packs and put them under her sheet. Like make sure they're wrapped in some sort of cloth so it's not just freezing and cold and wet where she lies down, but just a few around where she would lie, not directly, just around, and I have found out in situations where I cannot control the heat for whatever reason, this is the best way to give me some coolness. Thing is you do have to be responsible if you're putting them away every morning and then getting them out every night to put back under your sheets but if you're really that hot and it's really stopping you from sleeping it should be worth it. 

Also maybe I'm an asshole (I just tried to call myself I'm not closer and so but we're still that this was the only one allowed.....) but I don't see how a fan would affect asthma in a way that an AC window unit wouldn't. They're both blowing air at you right? One just everything cooled down. Because yeah when we moved into this new place my window AC which usually works just fine wasn't getting temperature low enough even though this room is smaller but when I added a fan, that was enough to allow me to lay down and comfort minus the vomiting.",1,2025-08-12 08:28:11,False,AITA not letting my girlfriend lower the temperature in our home any further?,828,2025-08-11 22:19:35,827,,,,,,[]

n8bduh6,1mo035e,AmItheAsshole,RemarkablePresence,"YTA. Your GF’s issue is being comfortable while she sleeps. Your issue is being comfortable while working in your office in the morning and the cost of the AC. You started by collaborating with your gf on a solution but unfortunately that didn’t work. Instead of continuing to collaborate on a solution that worked for both of you, you wanted your gf to compromise by using a fan. When she said that wouldn’t work, you went to an ultimatum that you would no longer run the AC and that makes you the asshole.
For this particular issue, there are a number of other solutions you could try - Put a space heater in your office, buy some warm comfy sweat clothes or robe for your office, buy a different window unit, ask your gf to cover the extra utility costs, etc. But instead you went straight to demanding that you get what you want.
As far your relationship, this is a great time to practice collaborating and agreeing on a solution that works for both of you.

n8bfumt,1mo035e,AmItheAsshole,StinkyCheeseWomxn,"\#1 - this is not about any objective measure of temp, it is about you caring about your partner's ability to sleep and be happy. 

\#2 - get a smart thermostat and learn when you need to turn down the temp to get it comfortable for sleeping, that might need to happen a few hours before bedtime, and set up a routine on the thermostat to make that happen. 

\#3 - if you want to save some AC $s in the south without a major affect on quality of life, close off the vents in any unused, or rarely used, rooms/spaces in the house. I have closed the vent in our guestroom (until we have a guest), guest bathrooms, close all your closet doors after you access them (unless you are trying to store some kind of climate controlled books or art), close the pantry areas, laundry areas (unless it is laundry day), and formal dining room, etc. These are simple actions that can removed hundreds of cubic feet from your AC demand with basically zero effect on actual comfort.  My pantry is warm when I pop in to grab an ingredient, but who cares? 

\#4 - check your insulation and weather stripping. There may be a few windows or doors that just need a $10 home improvement caulking, draft stopper or add some insulation to your attic, and you'd save that cost easily over a few months. 

\#5 - I've been married for 35 years, your peace, health, sex life and relationship are all gonna be better if you don't begrudge your partner the comfort they need to be happy in bed.

I use a Nest thermostat so the timer lets the a/d go up if I'm not home. I've tried to save money by keeping the a/c at 75, but couldn't handle it. It's usually set at 73. During summer, I don't put a blanked or even a top sheet on the bed. I got used to not having any covers staying at a friend's house. She kept the a/c higher than I liked. I would put a sheet on the couch but nothing over me.

I've broken up with girlfriends when I realized we didn't have much of a future when I'm dying from how hot it was in their place.

n8dsqrk,1mo035e,AmItheAsshole,culprit007,"Window units suck @ss - they're loud, ugly, and inefficient even when installed properly, and placement is also often an issue. Comparing a minisplit to a window unit is actually kind of insane, and I'm astounded by some of the comparisons attempted in these comments.

That being said... what's the coolest room in your house? Can you swap rooms with, say, your office or another bedroom? Can you buy or borrow a handheld infrared thermometer to gauge ambient room temps (and adjust vents accordingly) and vent output temps?

Are *both* of you home during the day? If not, maybe turn up the daytime temp to 78° and put the window unit in your office - pop a magnetic cover over the HVAC vent in that room so you're not cooling it via central when you're not in there.

Can you program your thermostat to cool in stages - 78° during the heat of day, 74° before you leave your office &/or she comes home, 68° from just before bedtime to just after her waking time?

The real question here, though, is this: what is your GF's comfort worth TO YOU - not only financially, but emotionally? This *feels* like a deeper issue than a slightly elevated electric bill. Is GF not working right now? Is she contributing *nothing at all* or just *not enough?*

You're NTA, but you're neither addressing the root problem nor making sensible adjustments to your energy consumption and/or sleeping arrangements.

I'm in the lower coastal plain of GA, and the heat and humidity have been miserable. I only keep my AC on 79° and still took an absolute beating by those crooks at Georgia Power, so I feel your pain at the bill. I'm also a hot sleeper, though, and therefore have empathy for your GF.

n8dv3ha,1mo035e,AmItheAsshole,DeviantDe,"YTA   You can remove all clothes and still be too hot, but you can always put on more clothes or cover up if you are cold. 

The temperature of the room is literally stopping her from sleeping.  After extended periods of sleep deprivation your brain starts to think that sleep by any means necessary, even if that includes suffocating a partner with their pillow, sounds like a good idea.    

Fans can be annoying.  They just blow the already too warm air around, they don't lower the temperature of the room and can actually add heat to the room because of the motor. If it's oscillating, it's even worse because then it constantly moves hair on your head and your body, creating constant movements on your body that can keep you awake.  They can also blow dust around and trigger sore throats and asthma or even just sneezing which will also keep you awake.

Close the vent in your office at night, this may help twice over -1st by letting your office be warmer, and 2nd, if it's on the same duct but the office is closer to the unit than the bedroom is less of the cold air will be lost before it reaches the bedroom.  Put on a thicker shirt.  Turn the overall temperature down earlier in the evening to prep the bedroom and keep the door closed to trap what cool air does get in there.  Get your vents cleaned and change your filters to help make sure you are getting as much cold air in there as possible.

She should be contributing to the electric bill since she needs the AC to run in order to sleep. If she kept things fair, she would be actually contributing to the household expenses. (idk what y'all agreed when ya moved in together). 

You suck because you just decide to keep the AC high and that's that. If the window one isn't working, then it isn't working. Sometimes these units aren't sufficient, especially if the temperature outside is high. Heck, I had to lower our mini split to 63 because it wasn't cooling at 68 and the room was heating up.

My (28m) girlfriend (27f) live together and we like to turn the thermostat down at night so we aren’t hot while sleeping. We usually keep it on about 68 and once we wake up I’ll turn it back up to 74 for the rest of the day then repeat again at night. I’m fine with keeping it on higher at night, but she prefers it pretty cold at night. I have a decently large home and we live in the south where it’s 80’s for the lows right now so the electric bill is pretty high. I pay all of the mortgage and utilities and have been trying to cut down on my home’s expenses. 

We agreed I’d buy a window unit for the bedroom that we could run at night just to cool that room and keep the main thermostat on 74 24/7 in an attempt to save some money. Not only that, but I usually wake up a few hours earlier than her and begin work in my office and I’m freezing with the cold air still running on me. She will not let me turn the temperature up until she is out of bed. Well a few nights in of using the window unit and she’s saying it’s not getting cold enough. 

She’s been getting up in the middle of the night and turning the central air down in addition to having the window unit running. I suggested I could get an oscillating fan to blow on her in addition to the ceiling fan that is already running, but she says it triggers her asthma. I refuse to run the central air at night anymore. AITA?

TLDR; my (28m) girlfriend (27f) won’t let me run a window unit in our bed room at night instead of running the central air. I want to save money instead of running the central air unnecessarily. AITA?

I understand that you pay the utilities and mortgage but that seems like a separate issue and something you are not happy about. So maybe have a discussion about her pitching in (not just because she wants to sleep comfortably) but because you need her to pitch in.

Those plastic accordion extensions in the side of a window unit don’t insulate for crap, and it’s practically impossible to get a good air seal with a window unit.  If you’ve got relatively modern higher efficiency windows, a window unit is a major insulation weak point.  Noise is another.  The mini split puts the noise compressor far from the living space, while a window unit puts it in the window (with very poor acoustic isolation).  Cost and ease of installation are other big differences (this time in favor of the window unit).  Mini splits also usually use inverter technology to adjust their cooling (and heating) “output” to the demand, allowing a more constant temperature.

Open the windows, close them just after dawn, and it’s a temperature inside that falls within the generally accepted room temperature range or even a bit cooler.

If it gets a bit hotter, the bedroom is cooled for sleeping. If it gets hotter again I cool the whole house. But it usually takes 3 days of over 100 plus hotter, humid nights without it cooling down at night before my house gets over 79. I can cope with up to 79 for a bit as long as I’m not sleeping in it and can just delay more strenuous housework by a day or two. Having a comfortable sleeping temperature makes a huge difference without running up large bills, and cooling just one room manages that perfectly. But usually colder overnight temperatures keep my house cool enough and it’s got enough insulation to not immediately heat up inside when it gets hot outside. I do have blackout blinds and also have tall-ish potted plants that I move in summer to shade windows from the outside - they’re fine, they need frost protection in winter so I move them to a sheltered bit of my yard then move them in spring to get more sun for growth and by the time it’s summer they’re sun hardened again. I move them back just before autumn nights get frosty. One is a ficus and could probably live through almost anything but too cold stresses it and it loses leaves.

>There is literally nothing about this house that is hers in any way. She is a tenant who isn't paying rent & he could evict her whenever he wants. He also can 100% pull the ""I oay"" card because HE FUCKING DOES. 

You clearly have been hurt and used which I get. So have I. That is why I clearly stated there needs to be a discussion about why she doesn't pay anything but that isn't the topic at hand though like I also said I feel plays a big part of his actual issue. 

HOWEVER, he is the one that asked her to move in and agreed to her not paying a dime. When someone asks their significant other to move in they are telling them to create a home TOGETHER. If this was just a friend, acquaintance, family member, etc who is just living with him until they get their feet under them, I would completely agree with your sentiment that they have zero say. 

But that does not apply when you ask your significant other to move in with you. It is both people's home regardless of who pays the bills. But again, compromise needs to occur AND if the no financial contribution is an issue that needs to be discussed. Personally, if there is no valid reason for any she isn't working, it would be a deal breaker. 

>then she should bare minimum be paying rent + utilities. She should also be the one paying for every single thing they try to cut down the electricity bill cost, like the window unit, any fans etc. Because this is HER FUCKING PROBLEM. 

Again.... This is separate discussion that I don't necessarily disagree with but AGAIN he is the one that AGREED to this living situation.

I see you're getting all kinds of advice. But may I ask if you've lived in the same place for those 3 years? 


I have had to leave my home because of mold mycotoxins. It's not an allergy, it's the toxins that mold releases when it's distributed or killed, a defense mechanism. 


It had caused me drenching night sweats, gastro problems, bronchitis, panic attacks, trouble breathing, severe itching, weight loss, dermographism, and many other seemingly unrelated symptoms. 


I noticed it because I left my residence for a week, and felt way better. 


Recently, I ended up back in a moldy situation for 2 days, and it was like a ton of bricks hitting me again. Severe tightness in chest and all back muscles and basically a constant panic attack.


There's a product called Concrobium that kills mold and makes the surface inhospitable for it to return. But a mold sensitive person shouldn't be there when it's applied, it's not toxic in the least, it's mostly water and a specific salt, but that's when the mold releases the toxin, (doing the entire basement is what made me move out) and the house should be very very well aired out before returning.


Hope this helps. ",9,2025-08-12 06:49:59,False,AITA not letting my girlfriend lower the temperature in our home any further?,828,2025-08-11 22:19:35,827,,,,,,[]

Huh? I don't have an electric blanket, I've never used one before.

I think I've just realised the confusion. I've not explained my use of heat packs and water bottles properly.

I don't use the heat packs to stay warm. I use them to stop the spasming in my neck and shoulders so I can fall asleep. My neck and shoulders spasm violently when I try to lie down and it's painful so I use a heat pack directly on those muscles.

Night sweats sounds hormonal. Birth control can do it to me (and it’s awful), if you are female get hormone levels checked as well as the scans. Doctors often overlook basic stuff while checking it’s not scary stuff and even with mental health illnesses you can have other health problems that aren’t psychosomatic. Maybe you do have anxiety that only has physical effects when you sleep. Maybe you have something all those scans will show up. Or maybe you have a hormonal imbalance that doctors often don’t think about unless you’re pregnant, post-partum, a teenager or menopausal. It’s just something extra to test if they haven’t already, and they often don’t because they don’t think to.

Doctors often overlook mundane stuff. My dad got diagnosed with medication resistant depression and saw a specialist in it who couldn’t really help him with his lack of energy and physical pains. A few years later he got diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that finally got bad enough to have more detrimental physical effects - it got treated and his depression “magically” resolved. Or they finally found the cause of his symptoms despite previously trying their best. Hormones are tricksy - if you haven’t had yours medically examined it’s well worth trying even if they don’t turn out to be the cause of your symptoms.

n8axhcx,1mo035e,AmItheAsshole,Duncan_sucks,"Maybe you need iron too? I don't have a deficiency by medical standards I was just usually on the low end of okay, but after I lost some weight I was always cold especially in the winter. I manage it by checking my gums and taking an iron supplement once or twice a week when they are pale(they should be a solid pink). When my gums are not pale I don't get cold easily, when they are I can be freezing in a 76 degree Fahrenheit room. As a not menopausal but fully grown woman I could just take it daily and not care because my body will naturally take care of extra iron once a month, but everyone else has to be careful they don't take too much.

I would also suggest a heating pad with a timer as well. In the winter I have a nice setup with a heating pad on the lowest setting and one of those outlet timers. It turns on a little before I usually go to sleep and stays on until I usually fall asleep. Then, I have it set to turn on again every 30-60 minutes to 'rewarm' my bed and a longer time again right before I'm supposed to wake up. It allows me to use less covers and I'm far less likely to wake up in the middle of the night having thrown off my heavy blankets while asleep but now shivering in the winter air. I had a heating vent right under my bed at college and I thought it was the nicest thing ever, so I made that setup to match it. It's very cozy. Having it on the entire time is too much though, I would over heat and wake up in the night.

I'm not sure about the cost of a heating blanket setup, but if you didn't already have the hot water on hand from something else before bedtime you do have a base heating cost from that. Heating blankets come in many sizes and I know some parts of the world use them instead of using a heater at night since it guarantees all the energy spent to heat an area is very localized to where you want it. I would suggest maybe trying the iron supplements first though if cost is a major concern.

But the winter in Scotland is very dark and wet, so it can be quite depressing.

I've heard Tenerife is lovely all year.

By the way, advice as a Spaniard: the way to deal with summer hot in the absence of conditioned air is darkness. Close the windows and the blinds during the day. Only open the windows at night when it's genuinely colder outside. And drink cold water.

It's OK for him to get upset when confronted with a boundary. So you shouldn't worry about his mood. You should, however, explain that he cannot always depend on you. Let him know that family, house, etc. will always take precedence over his requests. 

If you are feeling charitable, you can help him with a back-up plan for when you aren't available (such as Uber, bus, taxi, bicycle, etc. for appointments). Use this instance as an opportunity to share tips on self-reliance. Check social services to see if he qualifies for free assistance.

You are not his nurse or his social coordinator.  You can always say no.  And he needs to realize that your family life comes before his socializing. If he doesn't like that, then maybe he needs to liquidate some of his assets to pay for additional care now so that he has someone he can call to bring him to parties and such.

""I need to be able to rely on you"" sounds like he thinks you are family and not simply someone who is helping out a friend. Suggest that he consider reconciling with his family if he ""needs"" to have someone or move into an assisted living facility. That might free up some funds for the occasional long Uber.

Boundaries: Are you his Best Friend? Or merely a Friend? Perhaps just someone who is taking care of another person who can not do so simply because it's the human thing to do.

For instance: If the party was a 30 minute drive away and lasted for three hours ... would you invest 4 hours total in this friendship? What if the party ran long and it turned into 6-8 hours? Would you be upset or would you enjoy the party?

Perhaps admitting/asserting out loud what your boundaries are to yourself will help you explain it to your friend. My dad had issues that might be off-point, but an actual discussion (or three) on the topic of those boundaries was in fact quite useful and relieved later stress. He even learned that thing he'd forgotten over the years. He also admitted that it was frustrating not being comfortable driving at night or for any distance. Last year he gave up driving completely, but now he knows our boundaries and will (once in a while) ask very nicely if someone will go out of their way for him. He tried bribery first, and then realized that just being nice was useful. Something mom tried to explain to him for five decades. He misses her quite a bit and it's hard sometimes watching him deal with that. But we all have lives to live and they never did revolve around the cranky antisocial grandpa with a penchant for loudly insulting random strangers in public.

I have a former boss that turned into a good friend. I have known him almost 20 years. Since he never was married and is not on good terms with his family, he made me the executor of his estate and I will be inheriting life ins, property, etc.  I originally asked him to not leave me anything (money brings problems that I do not want) but he insisted. Since i live close to him, i am usually the one that takes him to medical appointments. I call him once a week to make sure everything is good. Recently he had asked me to take him to a birthday party an hour away and I was unable to. He is able to drive but is not comfortable driving long distances. He got upset and basically told me that he needs to depend on me etc. I told him I do not mind taking him to appointments but I cannot spend an entire Sat or Sun at a birthday party since I have my own things (family, house, etc.) to take care of. Obviously in emergencies i will be there no question (and I have) but I draw the line at parties. If it was a 1-3 hour thing fine but not all day. My main reason is because I barely have time during the week to spend with my kids and use my weekends as family time and to do things around the house. run errands, etc. I do not want to spend this time with people i do not know.

So just tell her that you’re setting up college trusts that will start paying out at 18 so that they won’t have to worry about an education.  You can acknowledge you have to put more in 12f’s account since 2m has another 10 years for interest building.  But both kids will have at least $1 million ready for their education at 18.  She doesn’t need the exact dollar amounts cause face it, with interest and such, you won’t know the exact amounts.  If she’s a halfway decent person, she should hear that her kids will have a heck of a fund set for them and be grateful that the kids get this life boost.

And then over the next few years, make sure 12f learns financial literacy, taxes, how to save and invest so she’s ready to take on those funds when she’s an adult.  I personally wouldn’t hand an 18 yr old two million dollars without any strings or education cause it’ll disappear quickly.  When 2m gets older, he has to learn the same things.

n85k4lx,1mnjm1v,AmItheAsshole,felice60,"I think your intentions are the best and your reasoning sound. I don’t necessarily think discussing amounts with your friend is the best ides at this point in all of your lives. 

One possibility is to create revocable trusts for both. Why revocable? Because you can’t be sure that you won’t need the money for you, any partner, or any bio kids due to economic, health, or some other catastrophe. Another possibility is to set aside a lump sum in an investment account and draw on that amount to pay for therapy, hobby lessons, sport activities, college or trade schools, weddings, downpayment on first houses, first cars, etc. as the years unfold. Dividends can be returned to the investment accounts so they can at least partially replenish what you spend. In your will, you can create irrevocable trusts for both of them into which the account remainder is divided and placed into each trust according to percentages instead of set dollar amounts in whatever proportion you choose. You could tell your friend that you are setting aside an undisclosed lump sum you will draw on to pay for extras for her children (give examples) that might be unaffordable for the family as her children need and wants manifest. 

I think you should keep in mind a few things as you consider whether to disclose anything about money set aside with your friend. One, your relationship with any and all of them might change. With the rate of relocation in the military, that is entirely possible. It’s hard to maintain the same level of connection and involvement when you’re not physically close enough to be part of someone’s daily life. Two, their family may grow. What will you do with your original amount of funding for her two children if she ultimately has, say, four? Third, I think you should take into consideration how she and her husband might feel about you implying that they may not be able to fully provide for their children. They may be appropriately grateful and see your intention as the loving gesture it is, or they might interpret it in the most negative way as you perceiving them as inadequate parents and providers. May be framing it this way would help with the third point: 

“I just came into an amount of money that allows me a lot of financial freedom. I love you, and I love both of your kids. Because I love all of you, I really want to contribute to your kids’ growth and future wherever I can that is comfortable for you. I would love to contribute to what your kids need and want as they grow as well as to their futures. Please let me know if there are sport or hobby activities they want for which you are comfortable with my making contributions. Likewise, I would love to give to them for college or trade schools, their weddings, or their first houses. May I give them cars when they get their licenses and you feel they are ready for that responsibility? I just want you and them to know that I am grateful and happy to be part of your lives. I consider you my family, and want you and them to know I’m there for you in that light.”",32,2025-08-11 11:28:22,False,AITA if I gave my best friends kids a different lifechanging amount of money?,8153,2025-08-11 10:36:46,1365,,,,,,[]

As someone has already suggested, make it about their ages and the investment potential. The 12f has only 9 years of investment for her money, and the 2m has 19, assuming they get the money at 21. Regardless, his money will have 10 years more to grow.

Also, please consider that these kids may have needs now, and tying all of that money up in trust until they are adults may not be the best option.

I 37f recently received a lifechanging amount of money.  I haven’t told my best friend, 37f, yet that she & her two kids (12f & 2m) will each be gifted a lifechanging amount of money in an irrevocable trust.  Here is where it gets a bit sticky, I want to give 12f 2.5 million and 2m 1.5 million.  The reason I want to do this is because I helped raise 12f when she was little and I still have her with me every school vacation.  She genuinely fees like she is my child, she calls me mom, and there is no difference between her and my own children, it’s the exact same amount of love.  12f abused when she was younger which has resulted in several mental issues.  Her therapist has said it may be difficult for her to live a normal life and she will likely need lifelong therapy.  2m has his dad in his life (12f’s dad OD’d), his dad is a lifer in the military, and 2m is very blessed with new clothing, toys, etc (12f is not). 2m is setup better in life, it is what it is.  I grew up as the black sheep of the family and did not get the same opportunities my siblings did and has had a lifelong ramification.  I look at 12f’s life and I can’t help but see her childhood shaping up to be like mine and I don’t want that.  While I can’t change her situation, I can give her money to use to help her future.  Money is a tool after all. 

My concern is how my friend will take this.  In her eyes they are both her children, and they are treated equal.  I don’t want her to see the discrepancy in the amount and think I don’t love 2m as much or I see him as lesser than his sister, and I don’t.  But I am more invested in 12f and my motherly instinct is to provide and protect her.  In addition to this, this is a gift.  This is on my own free will and why can’t I do this?

n86el0a,1mnjm1v,AmItheAsshole,ColdHardPocketChange,"NTA, but you know, you can always talk about this with your friend. In some ways, you're giving far too much to the children and robbing biological mom of her ability to parent as she sees fit. Unless you're about to die, you can always give more money later. In my opinion, your most reasonable course of action is to set up much lower and equal dollar amount trusts for both kids that geared for very specific purposes (education, therapy, down payment on a house, and a reasonable car). This alone relieves the parents of a massive burden in planning for a future for their kids as it will already be secured. After that, decide on larger amount you want to give to your friend to do with as she sees fit. You may have an idealized plan in mind, but remember you're dealing with an adult. You should be prepared that she does some very surprising and dumb things with it. 

I would like you to consider something else though. You are thinking way too hard about this from an emotional justification stand point when you can simply cover up your current plan with math. The reality is that putting 1.5M into a trust that is invested for a 2 year-old will see it be far larger then what you're giving the 12 year-old by the time the money is actually useful to them as an adult. This alone is enough to justify a $1M discrepancy. If you need help understanding this concept, you should just play around with a compound interest calculator. Assume the 12-year old will access the money in 6 years (so 6 years of growth) and the 2 year old will access it in 16 years. That's an insane amount of time for money to just sit and grow.",1,2025-08-11 14:00:28,False,AITA if I gave my best friends kids a different lifechanging amount of money?,8153,2025-08-11 10:36:46,1365,,,,,,[]

Take the entire 4 million (God, I wish I had a friend like that) and put it into an investment account tied to the S&P 500. 

It will get an annual return between 7-10%. You have it set up to reinvest the interest for 10 years.

When each turns 21 they will start gettin payouts. I have set this up so they each split 90% of the years interest with the remaining 10% being reinvested.

Since you start with 4 million and you let it grow for 9 years when the payouts start it will look like this - THIS IS AFTER TAXES! (estimated 15% capital gains tax) This  is also based on the 7% returns, the nominal amount is actually 10% so these numbers should be considered the low end.

I don’t want her to see the discrepancy in the amount and think I don’t love 2m as much or I see him as lesser than his sister, and I don’t.

Many of the comments here, including one I made, are about how with the time in the market, 2m's $1.5M will be more than 12f's $2.5M by the time they reach whatever age you decide is right to allow them control over the money in trust, so it is fair and equitable to give 12f significantly more money. But these two sentences really stuck out at me given that you also said that 2m is blessed with new clothing, toys, etc because of his dad, while 12f is not because her dad OD'd. So the kids are already being treated differently because 2m gets a lot from his dad. 

I'm assuming your friend and 2m's dad are divorced, because if they were together, your friend would be a huge AH for letting her husband treat the kids differently in their own home. But even if that is the case, 2m is already getting things that 12f isn't and 12f is old enough to notice and appreciate that fact while 2m isn't.

Not completely the same, but my brother and I received different amounts of inheritance $ when our grandfather died (we are both in our 30s, and this happened somewhat recently). My brother and I have a good relationship, and my family is fairly communicative, so my mom prepped us as the executor of his estate so we knew there might be some difference when he passed. In our case, there were no hard feelings -- my brother and I have \*very\* different relationships with our grandfather, and by the time he passed, I definitely didn't have any kind of strong connection with him. However, it was not a lifechanging amount of money for either of us (unlike in your case), especially considering that we are both doing alright on our own, but it did help me pay of some school loans, invest in my Roth IRA, and generally feel more set up for the future. 

My own two cents too, is that how they feel about and how they decide to act upon the discrepancy is not your responsibility. You can give the gift of money with love and good intention, and from there it is out of your control. I think explaining some of what you did in your post would be helpful (explaining that money doesn't = love, and that 12f needs a little more support since she doesn't have the same kind of network as 2m), but ultimately these kiddos are both getting an incredible gift from someone who deeply cares for them.",1,2025-08-11 20:34:52,False,AITA if I gave my best friends kids a different lifechanging amount of money?,8153,2025-08-11 10:36:46,1365,,,,,,[]

Depending on how you set it up the trust... 


If you set up the trust so they are only given the income to spend, it can be somewhat hidden from the recipients what the capital is. 


Also not all families compare notes about what they make, or what they got from inheritance.

They could get income residual (or dividend) money from the fiduciary or lawyer on a quarterly or yearly basis.


You could also write provisions of when they would be allowed to drawn down on the capital.  Such as to buy a house, etc. 


With a trust, it's not like where a will is publicly read to the family, though they could still seek out a copy of the trust as a beneficiary and find out from the trust's executor, it doesn't need to be obvious.

In a way, it seems like you have come into a life changing amount of money and haven't fully reckoned with how it is already changing you and transforming your sense of boundaries. There's basic psychological factors that merit careful consideration, that no amount of money can dispel. In fact, money ends up eroding the original basis of trust that the original relationship was built upon, because where trust was infinite and unquantifiable, money is measurable and, ultimately, finite and scarce, no matter how much there is.

It's noble to want to pay your blessing forward,  but your best friend is best friends with you, for who you are mentally, spiritually and emotionally, not for what you provide materially. Money can't solve all problems, and taking away what you think might be the biggest concern of theirs, could introduce so many new unanticipated problems. Like if, for any reason, there is a crack in their self esteem, the money could actually be a source of danger and attract negative forces they're just not ready for.

Can't you just be the coolest auntie in the world, who's always got their backs?

You will also need the kids' SSNs to set up a trust. 

I would tell their mom that you're setting up a college fund for them to go anywhere they want for 4 years when they get to college as you're going to need their SSNs. Tell her how you're appreciative of her friendship and see her kids like family. Say you'd like to set up a 529 plan for each kid which allows you to put a fixed amount into a college fund each year for each kid. 

Create a 529 plan for each kid but also create a second trust for each kid with the amount you want and fund the 529 plan each year from that trust. 

Talk to your CPA and an estate planning attorney to set this up right. The estate exemption amount could vary depending on what state you live in and any estate taxes could be affected by the amount you give to your own children as well as to theirs. 

You want to have more than just an estate plan and a trust for it, but a plan for the taxes as well.

I always tell my kids that I treat them equally and love them equally. However, if I'm trying to be equal- that doesn't mean 1 hour to each kid, or $100 to each kid. It means I want each kid to feel like they have the energy from me they need - and sometimes one kid needs four hours and another needs 10 minutes. 

Sometimes, to make my kids feel equal financially, maybe one has an unexpected expense and is behind their siblings as a result. If I want each kid to end up with $100, one might need $5, whereas another might need $65. 

Equal doesn't mean equal share to me. It means equal end result. 

And as other redditors have noted, the interest gains for the 2m will actually far exceed what the 12f receives as it will have ten years more growth. I would actually consider sliding the scale a little more in 12f direction myself.

n8a7jkx,1mnjm1v,AmItheAsshole,TheDarkHelmet1985,"NTA.. I'm an estate/trust planning attorney in two (almost a 3rd now) states and have these conversations with clients like you. My best advice is to contact your friend and ask her to hang out for a girls night or something similar. Be upfront that you have good news you want to discuss with her.

Don't be weird about it. Be up front that you came into some money. How honest you want to be about the amount is up to you. Tell her that you care about her and her children and you want to give the kids something to help them in life and help your friend have an easier life not worrying about the kids expenses and education. 

Then explain what you explained about. They way you explain it is by pointing out the age difference. The 12F is 10 years older than her other child. She has unique individual concerns. The additional money you want to give to her is not just about your close relationship with her and is not an indication of your feelings towards her other child. You are taking into account the age difference, lack of father, and her personal needs. The 2M child will earn a lot in interest in that 10 year period between him receiving the money and turning 12 years old. He likely may even have more than 12F got by the time he is the same age. 

Once you have laid out your plan, tell her that you haven't talked to anyone other than an attorney (if you have) and that you wanted to discuss with her before anything to see how she feels about the idea. Let her comment on it. Take the good with the bad. Understand that she may feel different than you but that its your money and you can do what you want with it. Either way, she needs to be involved in the planning of the funds and needs to be ok with what you are doing. If she really gets stuck on the different amounts that there are other ways you can make it up to the 2m over his life if the money runs out or if exceptional needs come up for him that are not foreseeable if that is in the cards for you. You could put part in a 529 plan. You could get the kids ""Jobs"" as models which would allow you to start ROTH IRA accounts for them.

n8arc9n,1mnjm1v,AmItheAsshole,seventurtles123,"Not to alarm you but there are so many ways this could go poorly that you need to talk through with a financial advisor. First, if you are set giving these children money, the mother may pressure them into using their share for experiences or household funds (or pressuring you). It doesn't matter if the mother is given money, just look at famous parents and see how that much money corrupts the relationship (jojo siwa, jeanette mccurdy, different youtuber dynamics). 


Second, the mother or children can throw away their future assuming that they have enough money to sustain themselves for life without really thinking about how quick that amount goes. An attitude of ""who needs college when you have interest?"", ""I dont need a retirement, my kids will provide"" or ""whats the point of getting a job if I already have enough"".


 Third, thinking about the 12F and her predisposition to drugs due to trauma and exposure, giving this amount of money as a young adult may allow an addiction to arise. She may never touch the stuff, but if she has that much free money, she may have the rock bottom or moment of clarity much later than other addicts. When you use your last $20 meant for baby formula or steal your mothers wedding ring out of desperation, there is a nagging feeling that you have crossed a line of no return and need out. If there are no real consequences, it hits differently. Waiting to inform anyone you have this amount set aside compounding interest would be the best course of action. On top of that, having set guidelines for its release would help. If the child feels limited in experiences or future prospects, you can jump in and let her know you are there to help her throughout her life. Go ahead and ask her what her ""ideal"" school would be when the time comes or what the ""best day ever"" would look like for a trip out, but do not make the value of money obsolete for someone who isn't in a place to understand it. 


Also, I know you identify with her but be sure that you have set yourself up for success. Save some for retirement, your future kids, yourself, emergencies, ect.

n8cbiwr,1mnjm1v,AmItheAsshole,DokCrimson,"NAH. I think it's mainly an appearance thing. You indeed have favoritism towards one kid... you love them both, but yeah you have a favorite. If I was the friend, I would be very thankful that I received any money, but it would always be in my head that you don't see my kids equally... something I would just deal with for a long time. It would also make me look at everything you do for the kids and it would be under that scrutiny

I feel like there's got to be a better way of splitting it where you give both 1.5 mil and then put the other 1 mil for the 12f in some other way so that it looks like it's equal upfront but ultimately the 12f does have another 1 mil. Maybe it's something like you want to make sure she has the same provisions that a father would have provided since the 2m does have their Dad?

Another possible way is to put their money of the trust in investments that they don't have access to at the moment. So, 1.5 mil each until they're 18. The 2m will compound to a much higher amount by the time they're 18... so you are evening it out by giving the 12f another 1m up front since the 2m will have another 10 years of compounding interest. In this way, they both will actually end up with a much higher amount in the long run

They dont even have to know who gets what unless the trustee is their mother. I took care of my autistic elderly uncle for the last 6 yrs of his life. He died unexpectedly with a decent amount of $ "". However his will was written by my grandmother in 87. He died in 21 and my aunt was his PA. Mind u the onky reason he had $ left was due to me caring for him. he would have been put in a home if I hadn't stepped up and his $ would have been gone.  The $ was split amongst his siblings 5 ways. 2 siblings had passed, my mom and my uncle so it went to their kids. My cousin and 2 aunts who never lifted a finger got 30k. I had to split with my sister who never did a thing. And then my aunt, his PA, got 30 k. I did all the work and got the least amount. I know for a fa g my grandma would not have kept this will had she known when she wrote it, her 7  yr old granddaughter would provide his end of life care.

Then my parents had a trust.  I provided both of their end life/hospice care in their home. Mom first and theb dad 5 yrs later. Mom was longer but I had more help. Dad went super quick.  Was prettt normal Drove himself to a dr apt on a Wednesday and was gone in 3 weeks, with onky 5 days at home.  Mom was sick for years, to the point we thought she was either a hypochondriac or had munchausen...spent heats going to dr aptts.  Then went to a dr on Friday (10/26) and they kept her overnight for fear of blood clot. She was in the hospital for 2 months. Then came home for a week (12/23-12-29) after all kinds of chemo complications she decided on hospice so went to a home for 2 days. We checked her out New Years Day and she passed at home 1/28/2019.  

My sister did the absolute bare minimum for both. Something my parents knew would happen. My mom used to tell my dad to make sure he was nice to me as I would be taking care of him in the end and it was true for both. I definitely spent more time with them and was closer. I wad also the irresponsible one a d we went back and forth abt who would be in charge of the trust as they had a few homes and s lot of investments.  My sister and I are 11 yrs a part and not close. ( ee have become closer si ce they died) so I didnt want to have to asked her permission every time I needed $.  Put trust was revocable and it finally got paid out abt 18 months later. However,  I did not get any approval over what she was spending and feel like she coat me almost 50k between taking losses on the homes, not fixing them up prior to selling, the auction company she hired instead of an estates sale(robbed us bkind!!!,  professionak pics, realtors fees, a memorial service my parents didn't want... and initially, we said I'll keep my condo she can sell and keep a diff property... hers ended uo going for 20k more.

I would give them both $2M and let them access the money at age 18 ONLY to pay college tuition or career training.

Then I'd free up more at age 25 to pay for a wedding and/or house.

Maybe a clause in there to allow it to be used for IVF and/or childcare expenses in case they have a child before the rest is released?

I wouldn't start giving them regular (not earmarked) disbursements from the trust until age 30 or preferably 35. By then they will hopefully be mature enough to know how to manage the money and not blow through it.

You can also set up the trust so that they can only access a certain percent (for example 5% of the principal) in a calendar year. 

This wouldn't include interest/capital gains, so if they have $5M in the trust at the beginning of the year and it grew 7% by the end of the year, they could withdraw the 7% growth ($350,000) plus the 5% allowed from the principal ($250,000).

You're very generous. I think outright saying to anyone that you prefer one child over the other is never a great idea, and I would avoid telling the mom that's why. Because mom will love both her kids, and also she might tell brother's dad or it could otherwise get back to the siblings that you prefer one of them. And that will only cause problems for the siblings; we can't expect an immature older boy to handle that with grace, or a immature older sister not to brag. 

Personally I would come up with an explanation now that you'll be able to stick to as the kids age. For example, sister was older and her money would have less time to mature/gain interest as she aged whereas brother's would compound for longer. Or, sister's additional money was because she would have additional medical needs or didn't have a father to contribute, or something of the sort.",0,2025-08-11 12:14:51,False,AITA if I gave my best friends kids a different lifechanging amount of money?,8153,2025-08-11 10:36:46,1365,,,,,,[]

Giving her extra money  encourages and rewards her to stay attached to being a victim.

The hope is that she will take the tragedy of that experience and transform it into a strength, perhaps using her knowledge and strength to guide others from victimhood to victor, from survivor to thriver.

OP, please keep it simple math. Leave out everything emotional and situational. If your best friend hounds/nags/tries to guilt or whatever, stick solely to “10 additional years compounded interest.”

Your friend and her current partner know exactly how much the discrepancy in how her children are treated at home affects the 12 y/o and will affect the 2 y/o as he starts to notice how much more he has, that he has a father and his half-sister doesn’t, etc. Let’s hope your friend does not allow him to become a brat or bully towards his sister.

The fact is that your friend’s children are not treated equally AT ALL. From your description, your friend’s partner doesn’t even consider his stepdaughter a daughter. Sure, he and your friend might provide the basics and therapy, but when it comes to extras, it’s only her 2 y/o. And if her partner has extended family who also only consider the 2 y/o as a “real” grandchild/nephew/cousin, the 12 y/o is going to feel increasingly alienated and “othered.”

1. Does your best friend actually need to know the amount? You can make it so 12 begins getting a monthly allowance to help cover a certain amount every month once she reaches a specific age. I’d highly recommend that be the case because it’s not assured that the money will be used for her benefit as a child. The same can be said for 2.

2. If they don’t know about it until after they reach adulthood, then would it really matter how much each one gets? 

3. If you want to make sure the girl’s life is changed now, use your money to do special things for/with her now but don’t give control of that money to her parents, ever. 

Unfortunately, money changes people in unexpected ways. I would think long and hard about how you give the money & when. The difference in amounts can be explained by ages, interest, and relationships. You don’t have to justify yourself. At the same time, I wouldn’t tell your friend about the money for the kids until the kids are old enough to know about the money first.

If the goal is to actually give the older child more money than the younger child, then that is a ticking time bomb of resentment that isn't worth the extra money, when it's already life-changing.

The math checks out too. A roughly 5% return on the 1.5 will turn into 2.5 in 10 years, which is probably more than achievable just by sticking it all in the S&P 500 (assuming the world economy doesn't collapse, which is an alarmingly unsafe assumption at this rate).

I know nothing about trusts, but wouldn't it be possible to target them getting the same inflation-adjusted amount when they turn 18? Like put away the 4mil in the trust now to generate interest, the older kid gets 2.5 when they turn 18, the younger child gets everything leftover of the original 4mil up to 2.5, then they split the gains above that (maybe with an annual dividend for the older kid's split of the gains so they don't have to wait 10 years).",1,2025-08-12 04:53:00,False,AITA if I gave my best friends kids a different lifechanging amount of money?,8153,2025-08-11 10:36:46,1365,,,,,,[]

n863lvs,1mnjm1v,AmItheAsshole,MountainDogMama,"Yeah, 

OP read as much as you can on this and check with more than one lawyer on how to set this up. Trustee's decisions vary widely and you need to detail exactly, and I do mean EXACTLY how you want it distributed and when.

This is long, but I hope you'll read it through. I am on the other side of this.

My brother and I recieved these. Our trusts are set up almost exactly the same. Mine had one additional consideration for my mental health care bc I can't really work. I received 75% of the inheretance, and my brother received 25%. He has always supported my mom's decision on this. We have never had any conflict about money. I'm close to 50y.o. My brother is a little under 60. My mental health was to be prioritized over everything else. 

My brothers trustee was rigid. He required all receipts, and a written explanation of that cost/purchase before he would distribute any money. 

My house needed a new roof and some other repairs. My first trustee harasssed my insurance company over the deductable. For the interior repairs/updates my trustee wanted a detailed contract. I had used this contractor for years. He was a sweet heart. He helped clean out my basement  during my in home therapy for hoarding, made not one negative comment. ""I'll always help you out"".

His invoices are very detailed, clear, and professional. I had enough cash to pay 50%. When he called me and told me that my trustee would not pay him, I was furious. We are talking about $7000, and I already had a buyer for the house as long as those fixes were done. It took 3 months to get him paid. 

(If you use a trust management company, they choose trustees, not you, not the beneficiary) My 4th or 5th just gave me whatever I asked for. The interpretation of the trust agreement varies from one trustee to another. Mom's will was 8 pages, our trust agreement is 32 pages long. Not one trustee, in the past 8 years,  has made any effort to understand my deficiencies or limitations. Last week I got a new trustee (#6 I think), and I'm hoping she is more receptive.

Here's the really frustrating part. I would not choose for my trustee to be anyone other than a trust management company. I would not put that in one persons hands. It will ruin relationships. Kep in mind they can bill the trust for just about anything they do.

The most important part to me, is that my brother and I have good relationship. We both knew what was planned. We've had one argument since our mom died, and it was stupid.

- $2,649,212 in inflation adjusted dollars.


Meanwhile the 2yo will receive:
- $2,809,472 in nominal dollars; and 
- $1,750,770 in inflation adjusted dollars.

Even with an additional decade of interest, it’s not enough to overcome the initial gap in contribution of $1m, looking at it in both nominal and inflation adjusted dollars. It’s not even really close to doing that so even if you criticise the assumed percentages above and apply them very generously ifs not going to change it. 

If you assume it will be sitting in an index fund instead of a bank account earning interest at a typical return of 7% instead of 4%, the 12yo will still come out ahead in purchasing power after factoring inflation:

The rest of the money should stay in the fun until they are at least 25 or so, and they shouldn‘t know about it until they get it.

n86d96u,1mnjm1v,AmItheAsshole,BrainOfMush,"I never said to give the money to them at 18. It's a milestone age that parents understand, and OP could use it as a benchmark to show that the two kids will effectively end up with the same amount of money long-term, given the age difference between the two. I'm sure there is also a general expectation that some of the money would pay for college. Makes it easy again to show that the kids will be afforded the same opportunity.

Let's say OP gives the kids 2.5 and 1.5 as she suggested and assuming conservative 8% growth p.a. with no withdrawals:

By the time kid 1 is 18, their fund is worth $3.97M. 

By the time kid 2 is 18, their fund is worth $5.14M. 

As raw numbers, the younger kid is getting a ""better deal"" by age. If you assume inflation for those 10 years difference between the kids is about the same as the past 10 years, kid 1 ends up with about 5% more buying power than kid 2 at the value of their respective funds at age 18 ($3.97M in 2015 is equivalent to $5.40M today).

By the time kid 2 is 12, their fund is worth $3.24M. Accounting for the 10 years inflation (36%), the $2.5M kid 1 would have received would be equivalent to $3.4M by the time kid 2 is 12, again 4.9% difference.

It’s not just a simple math equation on a page. Following your logic, every time this mother has a baby, this friend should be expected to set up new trust funds for each, without question. Give me a break. 

The mother can be upset all she likes, no one can control her feelings but she needs to work through it personally as that’s not her friend’s responsibility or problem. That’s where it needs to end. If she has the audacity to ask her friend to give her son a million more dollars, in addition to whatever she and her daughter are receiving, OP should realize she’s not someone worth maintaining a friendship with. On the other hand, the mother can ask her friend not to give either of her children any money “to keep the fairness” this comment section seems to be obsessed with (which is simply a shortsighted ask, but fine) ORRRR she can have the good sense not to broadcast to her current two year old child (who has absolutely no understanding of what money is now) when he turns 18 in SIXTEEN years and this monetary gift finally becomes relevant, “Hey son, do you know that 10 years ago, when your now 28 year old sister turned 18, she got a million more dollars than you? Crazy right?!” How in the hell else would he know? What would he get out of knowing that information? It’s not an evualation of his self worth or importance. Especially with the explanations OP has provided in the reasoning for the difference in amount. Does the mother not trust in her ability to raise a son who is simply grateful to a family FRIEND (once again) to have thought of him at all and graciously gifted him _any_ money, let alone money in the amount of MILLIONS? If the worry is that the sister would flaunt her gift amount in his face, then OP is correct on the amount of ongoing therapy she will need and their relationship was destined to be strained no matter what. 

Bottom line is this mother has absolutely no right to demand anymore money from her generous friend whatsoever. If she does and even has the audacity to try make her friend feel guilty about not doing so, it’s simply about greed and entitlement and a severe lack of appreciation for the kindness, thoughtfulness and love from someone who she calls a friend demonstrating how deeply she cares about her children.

If this is what you thought you were communicating, you need to do better next time. Literally dozens of people understood your words the same way I did, so that clearly seems an issue with how you used your words, not anything I did to 'pick a fight'. In fact, to me, your last comment here to me before I block you seems deliberately antagonizing and rude, and looks like you are *intentionally picking a fight and being condescending*. Funny how that stuff works, eh? Where to the rest of us reading your words, it just seems like you are projecting from here. 

If you want to be understood better by others, learn to communicate and use your words better. Especially, not attacking others when you are trying to make your own point goes a really long way. Reading over your replies to others most of your replies seem super combative and rude, which perfectly aligns with what you are accusing others of. 

Your original comment of claiming inflation will wipe out earnings on $1.5m in investments over 16 years is straight up uninformed and wrong, and now you are trying to accuse others of being rude and intentionally misunderstanding you. Be better dude. Nobody here wanted to fight anybody with their words except you.

ETA: After reading over a few further comments in this chain, I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess the above user doesn't understand the words they used, 'interest bearing account', has a real definition that people know and use regularly in ways they simply don't get. This is why financial literacy is important- because this person thinks we are all making fun of him when instead it simply seems they don't have a solid base of financial literacy and understanding.

AITA for leaving my friend out of a concert? couple months ago Ethel Cain (a singer me and my friend both love) announced she would go on tour for her newest album. Me and my friend tried to get tickets but they sold out within five minutes and we were really sad. Later on me and my mom have the opportunity to get two tickets for Ethel Cain for relatively cheap and then one of my mom’s friends is planning to buy his own ticket is tag along. The problem is that my friend is super upset that I will not bring him along even if he pays for his own ticket. I told him that a while ago the plans were different than they are now, and we would have brought him if we could have gotten those tickets earlier. I can’t even do much about what my mom wants to do. so regardless if I agreed to take him I have no idea what my mom would say. I feel bad for not bringing him but it’s more of a family thing now? Am I in the wrong?

Also for context I cannot drive and my mom would be taking us and paying for gas and all that stuff. She is also kinda mad over random stuff so I’m worried to ask her if we can take him

And I'm not saying that it's right.

I'm saying this is hard. You have a non-verbal child who is refusing to properly use the bathroom. There is a reason for this. It could be because he's always being yelled at when he's in the bathroom/on the toilet, so he associates the room with being yelled at. And you see how that's just a fucked up positive feedback cycle. Kid pees on couch, gets dragged to the bathroom and yelled at. Needs to pee. Bathroom is where I get yelled at, so I'll pee here. Kid pees on couch.

Maybe it's a completely different reason. But he cannot articulate his reason. This is a job for professionals. The kid needs to be working with a therapist that specializes with non-verbal children.

NTA, but you need to try and steer your parents to getting your brother the appropriate help. And to be fair, he could never get there. I don't know him and I don't know his situation.

I (20F) have a low functioning autistic brother (7M). He is non verbal and does not use the toilet. Instead, he tries to do his business on peoples chairs and couches for... Whatever reason. 

Because of this, I don't let him come over to the apartment anymore. This all happened after one day, my parents dropped him off for me to babysit him. No biggie, I love my brother. Well, 2 hours in, he decided to pull down his pants and peed all over my new, expensive couch. I caught him halfway through his leakage and dragged him away from the couch, sat him on then toilet, and made him sit there for a few minutes. This ended up with him having a meltdown of epic proportions, one so bad I had to call my parents.

After that, I decided I would no longer allow him to come over. I've dealt with the couch pissing for months since this behavior started and would always redirect him to the toilet. Now that he ruined a piece of furniture I actually saved up for and care about, I can't keep dealing with this anymore. My parents are mad that he isn't allowed at my apartment anymore and are calling me ""selfish"" over it. Am I truly the asshole here?

I don’t know if maybe you’re from a different ethnic background or part of the rainbow community and her mom or her friend has some conservative beliefs and she is ashamed to bring you along. If not, maybe she just doesn’t like you as much as you thought",1,2025-08-12 23:34:54,False,AITA- Still Wanting To Go To A Concert I Was Originally Invited To,5,2025-08-12 23:07:53,9,,,,,,[]

n8fbqex,1mowleh,AmItheAsshole,Call_Me_Egg,"Very soft YTA. I think I saw the other side of this post on here, but even if I’m wrong, from the info you provided, you are not owed a place with them at the concert even if they would be your only possible ride. I say this for the following reasons:

1. Wanting something badly is not the same as deserving it. Even if it seems unfair that another person gets it while you don’t. From what I’m reading, she didn’t promise you that you two would go together.

2. The reason she gave is perfectly valid. You asked, she said no. That’s the main reason I said “YTA” vs “NAH.” It’s fine to be annoyed at her answer, but trying to change it isn’t cool. Many things could be going on behind the scenes that would make the dynamic weird, as she said.

3. There are many non-car ways to get to a concert. Ride shares and public transportation would be ideal, but if that is not an option, there may be local carpools. I say this as someone who used to live in farm country and liked to go to lots of different shows in a time before  ride shares.

I wish you the best of luck!",1,2025-08-12 23:34:42,False,AITA- Still Wanting To Go To A Concert I Was Originally Invited To,5,2025-08-12 23:07:53,9,,,,,,[]

So an artist that me and my best friend really like is going on tour and we were going to get tickets to go with my friend and her mom. However, we couldn’t get tickets then because they sold out too fast. Now my friend, her mom, and her mom’s friend are going to purchase tickets resale to go alone. The reason I can’t go is because “her moms friend is going so it would be weird” I have offered to purchase my own ticket (obviously) and I can’t go alone because I can’t drive. This artist is literally top 3 artists ever to me and my friend and her mom have already seen her perform once. Let me know, am I the asshole?

n8fa45o,1mowleh,AmItheAsshole,yuhju,"I don't see the problem here, it's a public event and you're free to purchase your own ticket. Who is your friend to tell you what you can and can't do? (also, the mom's friend excuse makes 0 sense, how old are you guys?).


If you're buying resale, might as well splurge a bit more and take an uber. NTA.",1,2025-08-12 23:19:34,False,AITA- Still Wanting To Go To A Concert I Was Originally Invited To,5,2025-08-12 23:07:53,9,,,,,,[]
