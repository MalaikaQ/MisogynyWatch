So l'm (31F) out here on Hinge, doing what feels like part-time thumb CrossFit, and all I see are two species of men:
""Looking for something long-term, future wife material only"" (hello, interview panel) ""Open to casual fun, let's travel and see where it goes"" (translation: beach pics + zero accountability)
Meanwhile, I'm over here just trying to find someone who's not either writing vows on day 3 or trying to book a flight to Tulum with me before learning my last name. When I calmly mention my non-negotiables (you know, like emotional maturity, basic hygiene, and not thinking Andrew Tate is a philosopher), they vanish like I just asked them for their credit score.
I've met 2 creeps out of 100 - which, let's be honest, is a pretty solid ratio in today's dating economy. But still, finding real connection feels like trying to assemble IKEA furniture blindfolded, while being ghosted.
I'm not bitter - just baffled.
Is it that wild to want a connection that's healthy, flirty, fun, and doesn't require deciphering vagu

It’s kinda ridiculous how long it’s been, I don’t even want to say when I started talking to her on this dating. 

I’ve been trying to be very accommodating because I know she works and studies. 

I say I’m flexible and offered to take a day off work even, but she just doesn’t commit to a day where we can meet for a date…

She’ll leave me on read and then respond a couple days later. But she won’t perma-ghost me, she keeps reconnecting me, but doesn’t commit to any dates. 

I told her I plan on going to a concert at the end of this month and would love to take her. She told me she’s interested. I told her about my future plans to travel to Europe too. She’s also told me about she would like to take me to a trip to Montana in future. But I keep trying to set a simple sushi date and she doesn’t commit.

It’s like someone who just learned how to walk signing up for a marathon. like someone who just learned how to swim jumping off a cliff into the ocean. someone who just learned how to drive going on a cross country roadtrip.

My advice: I have younger cousins your age and this is how I’d talk to them because your choices and lack of experience got you here. Typically when someone doesn’t have experience with something they take things slow, research etc. This man picked you because you’re young, inexperienced and he KNEW he could lie to you. Don’t make it easier for a manipulative asshole to take advantage of you or your innocence. You see how your friend *immediately* knew something was off??? That’s experience speaking.

His wife gave her best years, and she gave him three children and probably took care of his sorry ass. She cannot get those years back. Trading in his wife for a younger version until he became bored, he is pathetic.  Then, he would find the next young, inexperienced women. 
The wife needs to know about her sh?thead  husband. Hopefully, you can do it anonymously because you don't want to deal with either of them coming after you.

Honestly I have no problem with age gaps in a relationship. I myself tend to date older, however, age gaps work best when both people are in similar stages of life or at least both adults with real life experience. At 22 you still qualify to be on your parent’s insurance and he has multiple children on his lol. You went to the extreme side of the age gap relationship when a more “reasonable” older guy for you would be 24-26. even though it wasn’t a smart idea I commend you for trying something because I was barely comfortable dating guys my own age at 22 and I had the same amount of dating experience (aka none).

The lesson to be learned here is develop the tools & skills needed to date successfully by dating guys your own age or 1-2 years older max. Eventually just like your friend did you’ll be able to sniff out the bullshit when someone tries to sell it to you.

n8crvlr,1mofsfl,dating_advice,Feuver,"It's always been this way. It's just gotten worse over the years as things get distilled and concentrated more and more. Loads of women with unrealistic expectations, led on by very popular/successful men that string them along for sex or situationships, or their girl friends gassing them up while being single themselves. Lots of very horny men that say whatever they think the woman wants to hear so they can get some action. And in between all of that, ton of people frustrated and lonelier than they've ever been.

When you're average or under, it's going to be a struggle. Unlike most things in life, the more time spent swiping on dating apps will not result in better chances or better skills. Without any feedback of what you're doing well or wrong, actually it's possible you get even worse over time because you get bitter, angry or impatient.

If dating apps aren't working for you, chances are that isn't going to change any time soon. You could get better pictures or improve your looks, which will help with matches, but then you have the entire ""can you socialize and flirt with girls"" wall that happens when you do actually go on date. If you haven't been blessed with a mixed and varied social group when you were younger, you have a lot of catching up to do.

Either way, I can only speak from my own experience. I simply have stopped using dating apps as they create unrealistic expectations that inevitably lead to disappointment. Instead I've joined group activities and social groups via social media, so I can attend karaoke nights, sports events and other gatherings with people I don't know. Going out there, learning to talk, chat and banter with just about anyone, will up your chances considerably of bumping into someone you're actually interested in. And if not, at least you had fun for an evening with people, instead of staying alone angry-swiping for hours.

TL;DR: There are people for whom dating apps are great and they get to meet a lot of people that way. if you're not one of them, stop using them and go out to meet people on social activities and events/sports/groups instead.",1,2025-08-12 13:47:48,False,Why does dating seem so one-sided,140,2025-08-12 10:54:12,120,,,,,,[]

She told me once she had 30+ conversations going on the app.  She had to create a website that was a basic ""about me"" and then had a form to fill out that had you answer some basic questions as well as some fun ones.  She set it up because of how many matches she got and felt bad about not getting to respond to them in time.  Her thinking was if they don't put in the effort to fill out the form on her website, they weren't going to put in enough effort in the possible relationship so she weeded matches out that way.  We talked for about a week before she told me about a guy she had already went on 3 dates with and they were kind of agreeing to heavily limit their time on the apps.  I'm not upset, actually was happy for her, but it was just a huge eye opener to see a fairly average looking girl be talking to *soooo* many guys at the same time and then just imagining how many more matches she probably has and then how many more people swiped on her without her swiping right on them.  It truly is like trying to find water in a swamp from the ladies perspective.

Women have dudes constantly giving them attention.  An average woman can pick any single dude with ease, just give them attention.  But that's the ticket.  If she wants you, she'll give you attention.  She'll put in the effort.  It will feel so easy that you'll start to think it's a prank (exaggerating a little).  If you're constantly trying to start conversations or constantly putting in effort to plan, she's probably not the one for you.  Move on and find someone else.  There are plenty of fish in the sea.  Unfortunately, like the women, you may have to wade through a couple before you find someone you like that likes you back.  It has to do a lot with timing and luck.

n8cru2s,1mofsfl,dating_advice,cleaninfresno,"You’re at the age now where women your age are at the peak of their prime in terms of “value” (sounds gross but idk how else to put it) on the dating market. Over the past 2-3 years you’ve transitioned to competing against guys up to like 10, in some cases 15+ years older than you without even realizing it. Guys who have been in their career for 5-10 years, maybe make six figures, or own a nice house or apartment. While the average guy at 23 is just out of college, in this economy and job market are likely living in their childhood bedroom and struggling to find a job. Theres nothing wrong with that, it’s just that it takes men a couple years to build that foundation as an adult.

I’m a few years older than you and it’s like around 18-21 everyone seemed to be on the same page, then as soon as the time I graduated college dating turned into what felt like job interviews with women trying to get a gauge of what your job is, if you have your own place, what your goals are, etc. There’s nothing wrong with that, it’s to be expected but it’s just way different than when everyone is young and broke and dumb together in college.

**edit**:

It takes a fair amount of effort including being attractive, relaxed, and not self-conscious/at ease with yourself; and even then it's up to personal preference.


By all accounts it doesn't seem impossible, just like a fair amount of effort; thus the sort of thing that's easy to end up accidentally-avoiding.


That said genetics does play a role as well. People have preferences individually and in aggregate. /o\ As with everything it's not one extreme or the other, but a balance.

If they are not interested in you then they usually make an excuse or give a vague answer. If they are truly busy, the ball is in their court to now schedule a date with you.

Me personally id have sex with her, and if she isn't interested, id ask for money, and if she doesnt have it, evict her.

""Being the nice person i am"" - you arent being nice, you were hoping for something romantic/sexual.

""she says she isnt ready for a relationship and we r just good friends"" - ""Hey thats cool, but i'm not looking for a platonic friendship. If things change, get in touch with me."" Don't settle for friendship if you don't actually want friendship. Just walk away. Obviously this doesnt really work since she moved in to your apartment.

Be careful letting women move in with you. Its more complicated when youre attracted to them. (I'm sure there are people who have no problem, but this isn't the case for you)

\--> You said you find it hard to strike up a conversation. This is a skill you can learn. Be interested in people. Ask follow-up questions.

2. Get a low body fat percentage. (This increases attractiveness.)

3. Get your sh\*t together: job, finances, teeth fixed, show, hair cut, resolve past issues. Own the parts of you that have caused this and accept that you can change.

4. Ask women out (online or in-person) and just go out on dates. Get comfortable with rejection.

n8ept0v,1morrfi,dating_advice,DearTumbleweed5380,"Hello. My suggestion is to first of all hire a matchmaker to work with on this, as it will probably involve developing a few different skillsets. If that's not affordable then I recommend brainstorming with Chat GPT and even role playing with Chat GPT just to get used to back and forth. Next recommendation: If you like podcasts listen to Love Letters, The Boston Globe podcast which had a whole season about where to meet people about two years ago. Next recommendation: join an in person dating support group. If there isn't one of those in your area then think about local activities such as: choir; skills groups and workshops. The reason I'm going on about skills is because I have been researching this for myself (from a different angle) and it's amazing how fun it is developing a new skill with other people. Including other people of the opposite sex! (I'm married but if I was looking that's where I'd look.) eg bushwalking groups, band camp, dialectical behavioural skills workshop. (Yep!)

Yes, there are adult responsibilities that need to be shared and it is important to have emotional maturity to deal with conflicts. But this isn't what life is about. I want someone who it feels safe to play with, to sing silly songs with, and to make dumb jokes with. Someone who I can feel at ease with. If I feel like I have to wear a mask, or perform to meet their expectations, then my inner child doesn't truly feel safe and I won't want a serious, long-lasting connection with that person. This is a feeling that goes both ways. If I sense my partner is putting on a mask or trying hard to impress me, then the vibe doesn't truly feel safe. I can't say for sure, but I feel you may be focusing too hard on molding yourself in the image of male desirability.

n899p75,1mo272r,dating_advice,shlomobo,"I think you‘re looking from a female perspective. I wonder which men told you that they want a successful woman. There are men who like successful women and there are men that dislike it, maybe even feel insecure about it. I know that a lot of women do care about the career and financially stability of a men. But the majority of men do not romantically care about your career or how much money you have / make per month. 

Indiependence is good but a relationship / deep connection automatically requires some emotional dependence on each other. In my experience very indiependent people (men and women) struggle with deeper connections in friendships and dating because it’s so hard for them to deal with dependence and commitment. How does your social circle look like? Have you maintained deeper connections?

You seem quite self-aware. Whether you are emotionally mature of course I cannot assume because I don‘t know you. This is something I think a lot of people claim about themselves. If you are actually emotional mature - a lot of people are not. And a major problem is that chaotic guys feel attracted to the stabilty of emotional mature women - which is not in your favor.

n8bl9c3,1mo272r,dating_advice,Stevelikestowrite,"You’ve changed yourself to fit what you’ve been told men are looking for? I have a couple of suggestions, if you’ll hear them.

Pursue a life that makes you happy. Do things that fill your soul. Act in ways that make you proud of yourself. Find who you are, the things you enjoy, the ethics you believe in, and create that foundation in yourself. Build your life on who you are rather than on who you think will be wanted. You’ll love yourself a lot more easily, and you’ll register who is compatible a lot more easily as well.

Get involved with groups that share your passions/interests (see above paragraph for how to find passions/interests) and make friends, build community with like-minded people. If at all possible, meet with these people in person and seek out communities that have both men and women: it’s a lot more connective than meeting online. This is where your energy should go rather than into changing who you are in an attempt to attract men. You’ll enjoy life a lot more, have friends to support and encourage you, friends you can be there for, and connections.

The dating pool sucks, and just looking for a date is often just a way to meet people you have nothing in common with. Building community is a great way to meet people who you naturally connect with and aren’t interested in you just for the purpose of getting laid.

Find yourself, embrace yourself, and work on finding community. It’s not guaranteed, but you’re much more likely to find someone you connect with by doing this",1,2025-08-12 10:24:05,False,"💔 11 Years of Dating… and I’m Ready to Quit

n8cnfck,1mo272r,dating_advice,researchshowsthat,"The problem is in the description.

People in general, and men by virtue of being people, don’t offer commitment to someone who tries to shrink themselves as much as possible, like you describe that you have.

It is a misconception that men will like you better and offer you commitment if you were “smaller”, “less dramatic”, “less problematic”, “less emotional”, “more chill”. 

The only thing you will achieve by diminishing your personality and your emotions is devaluing your own self and shrinking the space you take, which results in many blockers to a healthy relationship. For starters, others not ever fully getting to know you; you never being confident in yourself or having a solid identity; lack of respect from men because you don’t seem to respect yourself enough to be EVERYTHING that you are — in favor of being the “less” someone else once told you they wanted.

My suggestion is to spend some time reconnecting with yourself and others, and working on taking up space, owning and being open with your emotions, and doing the thing you’re afraid to do — reach out for help, ask for things, assert your opinions, uphold your boundaries, communicate your desires.

It took me years after my divorce (my partner who I dated for 7 years came out as trans months after the wedding, so no, it wasn't my fault) to learn how to date and find the men that I could genuinely click with. I learned over time to not mention certain things too soon, and when to talk about other things before it was too late, based on the caliber of man I was dealing with. 

The way someone handles a conversation tells you a lot about them. Maybe it's the writer in me. But I also had to learn how to let my silly side come out and not just be in ""observation"" mode. Making more friends in general also helped too. I love intellectual conversations, but trying too hard too fast with someone can sometimes appear desperate in its own way. 

It doesn't help so many people are emotionally damaged right now by these dating apps. I gave up on them for a couple years and eventually found my partner who I've been going strong with for a 1.5 years now. We met each other at a party and immediately clicked over conversation. I let him do some chasing during the talking stage, but also never made him feel like I wasn't at all interested (part of my issue in the past with dating was being too codependent and always chasing men, so i had to learn how to stop). 

He loves being able to talk to me about anything, whether it's about building cars or watching stars or laughing about an episode of American Dad. 

He's an engineer and very successful, though he isn't super rich since he's been paying off his student loans and helping his family. He got the job a little before I got my job, so we're still a bit early into our careers (about 4 years in). But I admire his drive. I respect his passion and effort for everything he does for us and for himself. And he respects me as an equal, as someone who makes just slightly less than he does, and loves when I get excited over something. We teach each other things, and that's one of the biggest things I love. 

I thought finding this type of man in a sea of  manchildren was impossible. But it took me just opening myself up a little and being ok with making friends and really taking the time to get to know people that made the difference for me. 

I have faith that can happen for you too. Even if things don't work out for me in the end with my partner due to some other circumstances, at least I know it's possible to find love even after I gave up at 25 due to the trauma I went through. (For context, I'm 29F and my partner is 34F). And yes, for those of you that think only a certain type of man get women, he's not over 6ft, doesn't have a six pack and doesn't make six figures. But we make each other happy. That's all I could ask for. Helps that he's still hot af too lol).

We want a friend, peace, respect (such that you value yourself and don’t disrespect the efforts we put in), and we enjoy a woman that basks in femininity while allowing us a masculine role. Think about the things your mother and grandmothers time defined as traits of a good woman. Most of those things are still desirable to men.

n8c1had,1mo272r,dating_advice,betterme123,"36 F and I gotta agree the comments are wild. There is nothing wrong with being successful and independent at 38. N O T H I N G. Anyone bringing up your mental health, attractiveness, or saying the fact you're proud of being independent is not good I think is a bit dululu. It's a great thing you can provide and excel for yourself. I personally got dumped in the past by a partner who freaked out when I said I just wanted to have fun and be happy in a relationship, and literally just got dumped yesterday by someone who was freaked out I wanted more commitment because he was just looking to have fun ""like kids"".

Everyone is on their own journey. The guy who freaked about me wanting fun had a agenda to start a family in mind and the other who wanted fun ultimately said he wanted to choose himself and didn't feel like he could do that in a relationship (basically said I was a long term rebound sooo I don't know if that's just avoidance form deeper thing from past traumas or what), but I shrunk myself both times to fit their ideals. I'm kinda with you on this one. If you feel emotionally tired of putting yourself out there, the safest thing you can do is pour that focus on yourself and set standards of steel. I ignored a million red flags in each trying to make them happy but the relationships we have with ourselves I think are the most difficult and worthwhile.

Also, for what its worth it doesn't mean you're the problem. Had an ex who cheated on me twice. Married the second one he cheated on me with and he called me five years later because she cheated on him so now he's out doing coke, hooking up with everyone, and wanting to be friends.",1,2025-08-12 11:41:50,False,"💔 11 Years of Dating… and I’m Ready to Quit

Look at it with an honest introspection about yourself. You have everything, any man that isn’t quite as successful as you will feel emasculated due to historical gender roles and identity. The guys you’re dating are going into the relationship already resenting you!.. they will NEVER get over your independence or success.. not your fault, but your expectations are naive when looking at how they were raised compared to how you were. 

Try pretending that you are a “girl” ..  men want to feel needed and respected. They got egos and until you are willing to strike it a little, you are always going to get the same results. 

I personally used to want to date the “hottest”, the “most successful”, the woman that turned everyone’s head when she walked into the room, but I found that all those “types” had serious baggage… they didn’t want a “man”… they wanted someone they could manipulate and control… to mould into something they wanted.

n8c7tto,1mo272r,dating_advice,kellykebab,"Lower your standards. Lower your expectations. And vet guys better for long-term qualities. Most guys only interested in short-term arrangements give themselves away earlier on. You're probably ignoring those signals, if not intentionally, at least accidentally.

You have a past post where you self-describe as being both pretty unattractive and highly promiscuous (at least in the past, if not currently). Well, that's not what guys are looking for in a long-term relationship. In fact, it's the opposite.

At this point, you can't change your past. You just have to accept that you have this less-than-ideal trait that will be unappealing to most men interested in a serious relationship. That means you have to get *much better* at avoiding men that a) prioritize a history of chastity and b) are interested in short term flings. If that means ignoring better-looking, more exciting, successful, charismatic men in favor of less desirable men.... well, that's just what you're going to have to do.

As for your looks, you might not be naturally very attractive, but in my experience, most people (even women) have not maximized their appearance potential. If you're overweight, then of course start sustainably dieting and exercising. Don't pick fad programs that you can't follow for more than 2 months. Pick routines that are challenging but you can actually stick with long term. If you have short hair, grow it out. Virtually all men prefer long hair, even the ones who claim they don't care. Dress as feminine as you can while still feeling true to your ""natural"" personality. And try to avoid obvious turn-offs and signals of promiscuity/erraticness like nose piercings, etc.

At the end of the day, no one ""deserves"" to live alone. But on the other hand, contrary to a lot of feel good advice, no one ""deserves"" to find love, either. If you have a lot of qualities that men don't find appealing in a long-term partner, you *will* have a harder path to relationship happiness. And you *might* never find a great partner.

n8a3u5d,1mo272r,dating_advice,Muchadoaboutfluffing,"First of all telling the truth will get people mad. But statistics and nonstop reports on how men are doing from every news outlet don't lie. Women are outpacing men in college degrees and ambition. (47% of women get degrees compared to 37% of men) Those are facts. Pew Research Center says it's across all ethnic groups too. 

Most women are fleeing dating apps because of nonstop sexual harassment and dic pics. Facts. Google this yourself. 


Most men just want sex no matter what they claim on their profiles. You are doing nothing wrong. I have this conversation with women every day at work, at the grocery store, at bars, restaurants and men lie all the time. They don't want anything but sex or therapy and use women. This is also why the statistics for divorce for 2024 are mind boggling. 300k men filed for divorce but 900,000 women filed for divorce in 2024. Women have had enough of bare minimum and emotional labor and sex crazed men. 


I've been on dating apps of and on for years for companionship and I can tell the quality of men has plummeted so bad that's why most dating apps are now 80-90% men! Women are done. We can take care of ourselves. 


Google this, men aren't ambitious anymore aren't going to college anymore, aren't going to therapy, aren't dressing well or grooming and have no emotional IQ. I read fifteen articles on this. I even sat in on a seminar showing statistics of how little ambition men have as a whole. Even Charlize Theron got in and off dating apps when she saw men saying, ""CEO of myself"" and ""school of hard knocks"" over and over. 


I have dated every ethnicity on the planet and ages 30-70 and all men want is sex. That is what women are saying. They play games, cannot communicate, are emotionally immature. It doesn't matter who you are, as women from all ethnicities and ages are fed up. Every dating app is bleeding women because of nonstop dick pics and sexual harassment. That's a fact.



Statistics don't lie: ****** I saw two dating apps financial reports and it's insane..and if 80% of dating profiles are now men, it isn't women causing the issue, or else men would be fleeing the apps and that's logic..


You are doing nothing wrong. You're awesome. Don't ever ask a man for help as they will tell you it's you no matter if you were perfect. I won't even tell you what to do but please know you have solidarity GLOBALLY with fed up women. 

Disclaimer- to all the actual GOOD MEN out there struggling, this comment is not about you. I know there are still some decent men left. This comment is about men who all they want is sex from a woman and lack ambition and communication skills.

I'm not engaging in huge debates about ""not all men"". The fact 80% or more of dating app profiles are men, speaks for itself.  Obviously there are decent and good men .

If everyone started saying 'I have been as fully myself as I possibly can be, and have fulfilled all my potential' and still can't find a partner, then I would start to say 'okay this is getting bad'.

n89k8ij,1mo272r,dating_advice,BDB8566,"My opinion, and I have overwhelming anecdotal evidence to back it up, is that online dating is a scam in which communication is blocked between “good matches” while communication goes through between “bad matches”. One possible way they can do this is by creating a rating system which could be based on looks or could be based on several criteria (looks / education / other primary characteristics). They can hire raters to rate all of their customers, and then block communication between people that are closer to equal in rating (or they can do this without hiring raters by using their data). For example, if they are rating people on a scale of 0 - 10, they can block communication between people that are within 1.5 or 2 points of each other.

For example, let’s say you are a woman that is rated a 6 out of 10. And let’s say that the OLD companies are blocking communication between people that are within 2 points of each other. As a result, you are only receiving communication from men who are rated 4 out of 10 and lower or 8 out of 10 and up. There are men rated 6 out of 10 that message you, but those messages get blocked because matches that are closer to equal in rating are much more likely to end up in a long term relationship, and long term relationships mean that 2 more users will no longer be repeat customers.

As public companies, they need to prioritize profit which means they need to actively work on making sure their customers are repeat customers. If the CEO doesn’t prioritize profit (over maximizing long term relationships), the shareholders will oust the CEO and find someone that does (or they will sell their stock because the CEO is prioritizing the wrong things). These companies would likely be bankrupt if they did not prioritize profit over maximizing LTR’s.

So assuming you’re a 6 woman, let’s say you reject all the men 4 out of 10 and lower. So the only guys you are considering are all 8 out of 10 and up. Now what does a man that’s an 8+ want with a woman that’s a 6? The answer to that depends if the man is an empathetic 8+ or an empathy-lacking 8+. If he’s an empathetic 8+, he cares about whose feelings he hurts, he realizes that he will hurt the 6’s feelings, therefore this man does not want any kind of relationship with a 6 woman. The empathy-lacking 8+ man, however, does not give a fuck whose feelings he hurts. He needs sex, and sex is more important to him than whose feelings he hurts. Furthermore, he tried to message 8’s, got no response. He tried to message 7’s, got no response. He tried to message 6.5’s, got no response. He thinks he’s getting rejected, but he’s being scammed like everyone else. Finally, he gets a response from some 6’s. Because he’s still confident enough to know that he’s an 8 (despite the massive rejections), the 6 is only good enough to manipulate and use for sex, not good enough to consider for a long term relationship, according to the empathy-lacking 8+.

The result...

Empathetic men get no dates because they have no interest in using women for sex if they know they aren’t interested long term.

Men that lack empathy (and have no problem using women for sex) get all the dates. The less empathy you have, the more sex you get. The women you get to have sex with are 2+ points worse than yourself.

Women 7.5 and lower get to have lots of dates with hot men 2+ points hotter than themself. The problem is these men will always lack empathy, and will always only want sex from you.

Women 8 and up get no dates unless they are willing to date down 2+ points.

Furthermore…

If this theory is correct, try to imagine what it would be like for a new legitimate online dating company to come along with the mission of prioritizing the maximization of long term relationships over profit. The legitimate company needs to build a huge user base to be successful, and they can expect to pay $X for the cost of customer acquisition (X dollars to acquire one customer, on average). Let’s say that their method of acquiring customers is using Google AdWords. How Google AdWords works is based on a bidding system. If my company bids the highest amount for keyword “online dating”, then my company is at the top of the Google search results (for ads, which are above the organic searches). If another company comes along and bids higher, they take over the top spot, etc.

So the legitimate company expects to pay $X for the cost of acquiring one customer, BUT THEIR MISSION IS TO RETAIN THE CUSTOMER FOR ONE BILLING CYCLE, say 6 months.

But then here come the big boys, say Match Group, that try to monopolize the industry and buy out any company that challenges them (for example, Okcupid used to be an awesome, legitimate, online dating company until Match Group bought them out and turned it into a scam). The big boys also expect to pay $X for the cost of customer acquisition (or less actually since they’re already established), YET THEIR GOAL IS TO RETAIN THEIR CUSTOMERS FOR SAY 15 YEARS!!

So that would essentially mean, as a rate (cost of customer acquisition / time), the legitimate company is paying 30 times more for the cost of customer acquisition / unit of time!!! How are they going to survive that? Well if they can somehow survive paying 30x what the big boys pay, then Mr. Monopoly bites back and just bids up the Google AdWords to the point where the legitimate company cannot survive. It’s a losing battle for the legitimate company.

The only 2 solutions, in my mind, would be to change the laws so that OLD companies’ code / algorithms are required to be open source (but the scam companies will argue in court that that’s not fair because they’d be forced to give up trade secrets)…

Or the other solution is for a legitimate company to come along, create a nonprofit, convince the government that the scam exists, and then convince the government that government funding is a necessity to successfully run a legitimate OLD company.

And to answer your specific question, “Am I pretty enough for a guy I’m attracted to?” I would need to see the guy to answer that. But I’d rate you around a 5.8-6.1. I am not into Indian women, though, and I think most men are not. I think if you ask an Indian man, perhaps you’d be a 7 or even a little higher.",-8,2025-08-12 03:29:56,False,"💔 11 Years of Dating… and I’m Ready to Quit

n8b8qwq,1mo272r,dating_advice,Feuver,"What kind of men say they want a successful woman? I feel like the opposite is usually true - women are looking for successful and respected men. The expectation is still (for a lot of women, anyway) that men are the providers and protectors, and women are to be protected and doted on.

To put all of this in perspective, we as men are often in constant competition to one another. In a financial/career sense, in a physical sense, in a responsibility/masculinity sense. Some men are more relaxed than others, but we often compare ourselves to each other in that way, subconsciously or not.

What's my point? The entire fact that you're successful, independent and strong fosters this exact same competitive sense that a lot of men deal with constantly in a lot of spheres of their lives. This can be emasculating or frustrating for a lot of men (even those who aren't inherently insecure), and even more so if you do bring it up a lot. 

This is why, if you're dating for a long term relationship where power-dynamics are involved, and especially if you are looking for a man AS successful or MORE than you are, you are going to end up with men who either have a lot of options (so they don't care about committing to one woman) or don't want to deal with another competitor in their home/out-of-work-life (so they don't see you as girlfriend/wife)",1,2025-08-12 09:22:47,False,"💔 11 Years of Dating… and I’m Ready to Quit

Additionally, stability is hot. Not everything is about looks. They are nice, but I think enthusiasm is even more important in romance imo. Generally, I want someone I can depend upon, so that when I falter, I know it will be okay.

I don't care about practical things that much, as long as they are adults who manage their own life and can make time to see me at a reasonable clip.

I'm sure there are people who are perfectly healthy and happy and just decided that they want to be independent for some reason. But I have a feeling that's more the exception rather than the rule. Independent to me just sounds like ""I have been through something that made me believe that other people can't be trusted, so it's me against the world from now on"". Whether that's shitty parents, shitty friends, shitty past relationships or something else, I don't know. But yeah, attachment issues are the opposite of what people want in a relationship.

n8b71us,1mo272r,dating_advice,BlackHorse2019,"I appreciate your feelings but I think you're generalising too much and trying and failing to walk it back at the end. It kind of debunks your whole post. There's a hint of misandry there too which isn't healthy or accurate when applied to most men. I think you're just straight up failing to empathise too. A lot of what you're stating is just not accurate or fair.

We don't ""just want sex"" (at least most of us). But if the relationship doesn't have a lot going for it, sex ends up being the only thing to bond over that both parties engage in, in my experience. A lot of us don't want to use women for sex, it just ends up being the only point of overlapping interest. In my experience, this ends up being framed as ""he only wants sex!"" which discounts our actual desire for intimacy. We are human, we want the same things as you, try and work with that assumption rather than projecting things onto our entire gender and you will end up with a more empathetic and accurate conclusion.

Dating ""successful"" women with high demand careers, who also want men with higher demanding careers just ends up meaning you both bring the same thing to the table - income (and not much in the way of interpersonal characteristics). And the relationship just doesn't work very well from most men's experiences. It's like her providing apples, when you already have enough apples yourself... it's just not appealing and doesn't improve anything for us but provides more stress that comes along with having both partners in a demanding field. It's mostly a net-negative. We'd rather just date someone who's doing something less demanding and happy and almost all men want her to be as independent as she feels she needs. It's not about making her dependant on us.

It means that women essentially outcompete men for something that men don't even care about when it comes to dating. It's like being forced to race your entire adult life for a high income that you don't care about, in order to attract a partner who you don't care about because them racing for income that you don't care about makes them unappealing. Why even join that race to begin with?

Men are disengaged from work and there are lots of reasons for this. Many reasons might be worth criticising men for, but the truth is most of us are struggling to survive and with no social support, we just drop out of society and do our own thing and the women (for valid reasons) aren't attracted to that. Most of us at some point in adulthood realised ""I've gone to college, gotten a good job but I'm working 60 hours a week, my health is declining and I'm doing it so that women will want me, but they still don't want me because I'm not 6ft tall and earning twice my income"". Our ambitions have stayed the same, they just aren't achievable by going to dating and college which don't result in a better outcome.

I think there's much more of a scientific consensus that women's standards for dating have exceeded what men can actually realistically offer. And as a result - Why on earth would we play that game?

You're raising the career requirements for men to the point where men are actively losing their physical and mental health just to be attractive to women, which in turn makes them unattractive to women. It's a lose-lose situation for us. Men's requirements for women are indicators of her physical and mental health while women seem to only want for us to do things that make us actively lose our health.

We are doing all of the work that you want, and it aint working even though it's destroying us. So we stopped to save ourselves and you're complaining that we stopped the work. Please empathise with us instead of just demanding us to work ourselves to death just to be slightly more attractive to you. We've gone to college, therapy etc and work 60 hours a week and we're still facing permanent and often very cruel and abusive rejection from women who want us to work ourselves to death even more.",1,2025-08-12 09:14:29,False,"💔 11 Years of Dating… and I’m Ready to Quit

Thing is, this isn't the only avenue to resonate or relate.

A lot of things probably need to line up along with the attraction that makes you both want to truly be around each other the majority of the time, which raises the likelihood of staying in an exclusive and committed relationship.

n8cacf6,1mo272r,dating_advice,Facehugger_35,"You're misunderstanding what guys mean when they say this. 

""Men don't generally value independence or success"" does not mean ""Men generally value dependency or lack of success.""

 What guys are saying is that men generally weigh these traits a lot less heavily than women do. It doesn't mean we weigh the opposite trait heavily. Men are mostly ambivalent towards a woman's finances, so long as she is able to fund her own lifestyle. And even then men are considerably more accepting of financial issues in women than women are in men. 

Financial success is a ""take it or leave it"" type thing for guys. Men don't generally seek it out in a partner. It's nice to have, but it's not a dealmaker and it doesn't weigh heavily in guys' selection criteria. It can even be a yellow flag because some women like to hold their financial success over guys and denigrate us with snide remarks or asking us to hustle more. But overall, it's mostly a wash. Men don't care much one way or another.

The nearest equivalent would be how you probably see something like... Hand size. You might have a minor preference one way or another, but you probably don't pursue someone based on the size of their hands. Instead you think about stuff like facial attractiveness, height, income, etc, right?

A woman's financial success for most guys is like hand size for women. Minor, not something you think ""wow, that makes this person so attractive to me.""",1,2025-08-12 12:23:34,False,"💔 11 Years of Dating… and I’m Ready to Quit

Most women have normal standards like you .


The biggest issues we are having is men lying and saying they want a relationship and all they want is sex. 


Or doing love bombing, they get sex, then gaslight and ghost. 

OP is saying she is independent and working hard and being a good person and wants a relationship. The issue is so many men are just using women for sex or playing games.

While we are in the subject, I'm curious what you want in a woman for a relationship. 

Here's one example of a mess:

There's nothing suspicious at all about how vague this explanation is.

Im genuinely not fully convinced they are real people, like non-zero chance some of them are bots made by the app itself to make up for the discrepancy of men and women on the app. There cannot be that many photogenic women in my city with the disposable income to have traveled to so many destinations.

Truth be told a lot of them *wouldn't date themselves* if they used the same criteria they use for others.

If a woman says, ""I refuse to settle."" She get an applause, If a man says it, he's *afraid* of commitment. 🤣

Each of us is entitled to have our own mate selection screening process and must haves list.

Each of us is entitled to have our own ""red flags"", expectations, boundaries, and ""deal breakers"".

There is a difference between ""settling"" and being practical or realistic.

Honestly, most people ""settle"" for their *best available* option. 

Few people given a ""choice"" between *a brand new car and an old rust bucket*, would take the bucket.

If one truly believes they could do better, they would do better,  Not every has the same options.

Too often you have people who are *aiming out of their league* or *have not cultivated the traits* that their *ideal mate* would want. In order to meet the kind of people you want to be with *you have to run in their same circles*. Instead of just *focusing on what she wants*, she should figure out what a guy *like that* wants!

Every good hunter invests time learning what *the prey* desires, what their habits are and so on.

It can also be more challenging for women since most them are in a *passive role of waiting* to be *approached by men* as opposed to seeking and pursuing the type of man *they* want.

Essentially, if their *ideal mate* doesn't ""come along"" and approach them they'll end up *just waiting*.

Not only does he have to walk on water but he also has to chase after her too!

Many people get hurt in relationships- both men and women. Yet it happens in different ways. In our society. Men are encouraged to be more confident and that they are entitled to what they want. Women are trained to please others and not to be too ambitious. These deep routed societal standards create toxic patterns in relationships. I don’t interpret the statements you list as being arrogant. I would say that women who make such statements are trying to break out of the matrix. I value emotional maturity and self-improvement so these statements are green flags to me.

n8d1ktp,1mogdhn,dating_advice,Honeyyhive,"Idk, people often laugh if they feel uncomfortable, especially women who are more socialized to be polite even when saying no. 

There’s a reason why there is 1st, 2nd, 3rd base when hooking up, because a gradual increase in physical contact leaves plenty of room for either person to say yes/no. Isn’t receiving a “yes” at every base more of a turn on anyways rather than rushing to the end and hoping it goes?

If I was kissing someone and they skipped to putting a body part on my pussy I would be super uncomfortable because it would give me no time to stop the progression if I didn’t want to go there. And if I did want to go there, I might be turned off because it felt like skipping steps and rushing to home base.

When two people are strangers or aren’t in a relationship, mutual consent and interest is less likely to be confirmed so you progress gradually for everyone involved. 

Your “spicing things up” might also be making people uncomfortable so it’s worth reconsidering how it might make the other person feel before you try it",1,2025-08-12 14:35:56,False,"I was making out with a girl and tried to spice things up, but she said no",62,2025-08-12 11:14:57,47,,,,,,[]

Back to your question, the dating phase is really for people who haven't spent enough time with or don't know well enough. You could argue that those first three months of me getting to know her and spending time with her was our dating phase. When you're in young and in school, your schedules and locations are fluid enough that you can spend a lot time with someone if the interest is mutual.

If you use words on a woman who is already unsure since she is your ""friend"", then what do you expect? They are bunch of emotions. Physical contact with the right mood will always work instinctively for women.

Even if you have never dated a woman, you instinctively know what to do in the right mood.  

That's why you always hear the advice: 1. plan dates, 2. she should have fun on the date, 3. eat, 4. have fun, 5. initiate for sex, 6. sex should be fun. Fun = Sex.

After that: 1. date again, 2. make her feel special, 3. kissing / sex 

And then yes automatically you will be bf/gf",1,2025-08-12 22:30:58,False,"Guys If you’ve ever dated a female friend, did you ask out or did it just develop and if so how?",29,2025-08-12 09:55:21,31,,,,,,[]
n8bxoru,1moe6ct,dating_advice,Artistic_Speech_1965,"It's normal mate, not every story is drasticaly similar. But there are a few rules that can help you manage this. I finished dating my female friend and I can say the advice I will give you will help greatly. I didn't use all of them at the time but today I know they would have worked

1. Work on your attractiveness. That's the thing that will move you from the friendzone or keep you in it. There are different axis you can work on. Like improving your grooming, your social skills, your emotional intelligence and your Lifestyle. Having a lot of female friends (and I am really talking about being friend with them and no more) is a huge accelerator for a lot of reason I couldn't list to keep it short, but you will find a lot of useful informations 

2. Don't act until a woman shows you signs of interest. Asking a woman out of nowhere is problematic for both of you, because she will instantly feel pressured without have the time to considerate it and you will get rejected quite fast. If she is interested you will see signs of interest from her inviting you to go a bit further (only if you want to of course)

3. Say ""interest"" instead of ""love"". ""Love"" is a strong word and can greatly pressure a woman. If you say confidently that you're interested in her, she is most likely to accept and see how it goes. Works greatly if she show signs of interest. You should lead how the date operate

3. Always go slower than your woman. Us men have the tendency to be too eager and direct making woman run away at the beginning. You just have to notice when she want things to go further. She will value the relationship more she will feel she is progressing things

We matched on Bumble (she told our group she was on there and I kinda wanted to see if we'd match) and we wound up talking but she was kinda seeing someone during that time. I wound up circling back around during New Years and we chatted and got together a few months later.  

Honestly I think just feeling things out and talking is the move. If things happen organically without a conversation, cool, but being clear about intentions and headspace is usually the safer method. 

Now hookups are different though...if you just end up hooking up until you're in a relationship that makes sense to me even though again, it's more responsible to have those conversations so both parties are aware of what the other is thinking.",1,2025-08-12 12:58:23,False,"Guys If you’ve ever dated a female friend, did you ask out or did it just develop and if so how?",29,2025-08-12 09:55:21,31,,,,,,[]

n8dctr7,1mon08s,dating_advice,[deleted],"It is very difficult. Even trained experts have trouble identifying bad people sometimes. 

First, watch if their words match their behaviours. This is a big one. Watch if they are consistent. Anyone can be kind in the short term. Look at who they are friends with. If their friends are misogynistic aholes then they are likely like that too behind your back.

Look at their career. Can they hold down a job? What are their future plans? What are they like when they are angry? What are they like if you say no? Do they push boundaries or respect them?

How do they talk about their ex girlfriends? How do they talk about women in general? What is their upbringing like? Are they close with their mom? 

Do they take accountability if they upset you or do they get defensive? Do they listen to you? Do they ask questions about you? Or do they just talked about themselves.

I don't like controlling people, nor demanding them to change their behaviour for me, cutting people off... That's all toxic and I stay clear from those type of relationships.

Someone I am dating has an ex in their life?

I will tell them its not for me, best of luck. Take care. Leaving the situation since its not what I am looking for. Respecting their personal life, but its just not my vibe.

I am looking for someone who naturally aligns with my boundaries, not someone I have to force change.

For that, I just rinsed and repeat. Only dated those who didn't have exes around. Eventually met my wife. All of it flowed smoothly since we're both NC with anyone we had history with naturally. No policies needed. Fit like a glove. 

I feel if you have to create policies, then your in the wrong relationship for each-other.

Couple of us tried to talk to her husband because we were trying to figure out what was going on. He was pretty unhelpful, but mostly because he was Persona non Grata with most of us by that point. He was pretty bad about cheating on her and being a useless fuckass.

Just, the whole situation was weird. Like, this all happened in our mid-thirties, and over the course of a handful of weeks. I'd known her and her sister since high school. She being a grade ahead me, and her sister being two grades behind me. Even her sister has no clue what the fuck happened, she got blocked, as well. Which is kinda funny, because her sister is a classic ""dyke"". Lesbian, short hair, played soccer and softball well into her thirties, and doesn't really think the greatest of men.

n8fab9y,1movoj1,dating_advice,lovealert911,"Lots of people who *aren't* socially awkward also use dating apps.

Granted the past couple of generations (Millennials and Gen Z) are generally more attached to their cell phones, *texting is preferred over verbal conversations*, playing video games, and using social media as a way to connect with others is fairly common. They didn't venture out to attend a lot of school dances/house parties and other social gatherings,

Many of them as teens were content with *staying in their room*.

I've seen several posts on this site from people in their *early to late 20s* who have *never* been kissed, let alone had sex or been in a relationship. These things were a *simple rite of passage for teens* in the past.

Today there are a lot more ""late bloomers"" and socially awkward people both online and offline.

Most people are drawn to apps because *it's convenient*, generally has more potential options as one isn't limited by their local geographical area, there are also *niche apps* for those looking for specific traits or qualities like age, race, sexual orientation, religion, curvy/bbw, and several other categories of people.

Naturally, *someone who hates going out* to bars/nightclubs/parties and other social gatherings most likely loves the fact that they don't have to step outside of their comfort zone in order to possibly connect.

It can also be more cost effective than paying cover charges and buying high priced drinks to mingle.

Dating apps are the equivalent of ""online shopping"" for those looking for a mate or a hookup.

Lastly, being rejected via an app is generally *less painful than face to face rejection*.

This is explains why the ""meet-cute"" you see in *Romcom movies* rarely happens in *real life* anymore.

A lot of guys whether they're socially awkward or not, *won't approach women* via a chance meeting.

They don't want to *interrupt*  or come across as being ""creepy"" and they can't be sure if she is single.

(Men especially like the fact that at least on a dating app the women are on there *to meet someone*.)

Dating apps usually *removes* the ""guesswork"" of whether or not she is single/looking to date.

Most people you meet don't become dates, most dates don't become relationships, and most relationships don't lead to marriage, As one adage goes: ""Many are called but few are chosen.""

I have very near and dear friendships with a couple women in my life, and I always have the thought in the back of my head, ""Will these friendships intimidate someone I'm dating?""

Initiate intimacy. Doesn’t have to be constant obviously, but make sure if you’re feeling in the mood you can initiate it too. 

Idk, those were the two main issues in my last relationship and they drove me insane so that’s my two cents. 

Edit: I will now answer the question asked in the caption (is it called that?) as I only answered the title. 

Pretty much anything he likes. For example, if he likes gardening, some new tools or a new plant. If he likes a certain sport, maybe a jersey or some other sport memorabilia. Stuff like this, I was giving generic examples but pretty much anything that goes with a hobby of his. But that’s if you want to get him a physical gift. You can also go out and do fun stuff just because. 

Anything where you two can just go and have some fun. A walk on the beach, a hike in the forest, camping if you’re into that, go to a museum, a zoo, an aquarium, a show of some kind. Idk how your boyfriend is but I know I myself am not picky and would just appreciate being able to spend time with my partner, regardless of the activity. 

Again, it all depends on what he prefers to get or do or if he’s even picky about that. Most guys tend to just enjoy the thought and effort put into things and focus less on what the gift is.

Personally, I have found every man to be very appreciative of oral sex with no expected sexual return. Though the latter usually gets fulfilled anyways 🤣

Acts of service is often much appreciated as well. If he's the type who likes watching sports games, dedicate a little attention to that. Ask him when the next event he wants to watch is happening and make it as cozy as possible for him. Dude will *melt* for a pound of wings, his favorite drink, and a snack. Let him be comfy and chill, bring him all the things so he doesnt need to break his attention from his relaxation. This is both nurturing acts of service as well as Quality Time. It may be something he's happy for you to join him in watching if you'd like. It may be something he just wants to do alone. Whatever his vice is, make him comfy and happy at home.

Sports etc. can work too), his interests (maybe he likes pottery, so you can book a pottery class, or he likes a particular author, and you can see when he/she launches a new book, to get him a signed copy of it?, or say he likes some sport or any physical activity, you can get him a new pair of shoes that's gonna be functional....like, say some running shoes that's fit him well? Anytime he wears them, he'll be reminded of you, and that's gonna put a smile on his face....)

In general, we men like something that's functional, durable and does the job extremely well...and if it's aesthetically pleasing, it's a cherry on top too :>


This is more like in the gift giving realm....and this all can take some time to figure out....in the meantime, acknowledging and just saying how much you LOVE and couldn't be more grateful if all these nice cute things he does for you.....that's always good. We all want our efforts to be acknowledged as well as someone can :>


Basically, try to figure *him* out.....
Like people say this 'love language' but essentially you have to figure out (like a woman detective) what tickles his fancy....is it more physical affection? Is it more kind words and respect? Is it more physical gifts? Or perhaps some nice, delicious food? (It's never a bad idea to learn to cook his favourite dish and surprising him with it one day 😋)

Basically, be a detective and find out everything you can about him by any ways and show your affection in a way that *he* can appreciate:>>

Cookies or Chocolate sweets. 

Leave a cute note in his wallet.

You can make him a care package: gift bag with some gum, his favorite soda, something related to his hobby, a good body wash or cologne, and whatever else small he likes if he's having a bad day.

Cover his bathroom mirror in sticky notes with compliments about him.

Send his best friend (or his gaming buddies) a message asking them to help you plan a boys-night. Either get him set with the gaming bros, set up snacks, and go out with your girls...OR have his buddies go ax throwing, golfing, bowling, to a movie, arcade, whatever. Pay for some of it with a gift card. Spend the evening taking a bubble bath and pampering yourself.

Get him a few gift cards to a car wash if he is a car dude.

Send his MOM flowers and set up a designated night every month to take him mom to dinner/breakfast just the two of them. (Like... Every 3rd Friday of the month is mother/son day)

Get tickets to a minor league/college sport event. (4 total, you, him, a buddy, and his buddy's girl)

Source : I am a straight man.

Last time I was given flowers, (Hibiscus) by someone i love and care deeply about; I was moved nearly to tears.

Also if you want to give him something masculine specific, I'd recommend engaging and taking an interest in some of his hobbies that you'd normally find no reason to partake in. There's no greater gift than actively wanting to be there for someone. Not in a constant persistent way like telling him to switch off an online game to play one with you, but in an understanding/participating way like, asking to play offline multilayer games with him out of the blue while you are both doing nothing, or offering to hold his tool and listen to his ADHD car talk if he's working on his car. These are random examples I just came up with.

Lastly, for bigger gifts, get him something cool and fun rather than stylish or expensive once in a while. Like wallets are nice, but I'd personally rather have idk one of them drones that rolls around on the ground or something (couldn't think of anything better)

Finally finally. The fact that you are researching and asking is a gift to him in of itself. The fact that you care is pretty damn cool. Hope it all goes well.

n890t1k,1mnlcas,dating_advice,BEETLEJUICEME,"#+1 for handwritten sweet notes.  

I had a beloved partner for a long time who had to leave early for work (ie: out the door by 7am) during a period of my life I often worked evening shifts and didn’t get home until 11pm.

In the mornings she would make coffee, and leave me a cup next to the bed for when I woke up with a little hand written note next to it. 

It would often be a note about something I had done for her lately she really loved, or something about me that she loved, or just a sweet “I hope your day is amazing” kind of thing. 

If I had something in my day that was going to be challenging, she often included that in the note like “I know you’ll do great during the interview” or even just “I know it will be 11pm when I see you next but I can’t wait to be in your arms again.”

They were just the sweetest and best gifts I could have ever asked for. I can’t think of anything monetary, or even sexual, in the favor category that would have made me happier than getting those notes so often. 

We ended our relationship, very amicably and for good but complicated life reasons. I asked her if she would mind that I keep those notes. She told me that I should keep them if they bring me joy because that was what they were supposed to do. 

That was like 6 years ago?  I still have them in a box. I very rarely look at them, but occasionally when I am feeling down I pull them out.

People can actually become interested in trying and learning new things when they meet a person they are actually interested in. 

Its actually a good sign when someone shows interest in the things you like. It means they are showing interest in you.

Its a bad sign if the opposite happens. If you share your interests and the person you date tells you that those things are uncool and uninteresting.

Guy likes anime? Comicon tickets. Or cosplay as his favorite character. Or just sit down and watch his favorite with him to discuss and let him gush without judgement.

Guy likes obscure waifu gacha games? Merch. A simple acrylic keychain of his favorite character will make him happy.

Guy likes vidya? Thumbstick caps for his controller. Or just not shit on him for holding this hobby as women often do.

I don't have any remark on the morality of it, but if you are getting dates none the less, it's probably extra anxiety for nothing. Also while cameras do change us a little bit, they don't do it that much unless your using a novelty lense. Most of it is probably your warped perception.

n8enjk5,1moshf1,dating_advice,Are-We-There--Yet,"Guy here, M53.  So, on one hand, can let it slide in that you are in a grey zone, and maybe even light grey area that, in that, just two dates, you are not exclusive, not stated agreed upon bf gf.  On second date you said you made out but did not go all the way.  Not sure what that means, maybe some folks would say if just kissed, that’s not hot & heavy so you guys are still just prospects to each other at this stage.  Alternatively, if it was intense fingering and mutual oral etc, very intimate an intense connection etc., well then maybe a reasonable person would conclude that that session was enough to create the basis for some sort of semi-relationship, or expectation thereof, somewhat down the road to exclusive bf gf etc.  But it’s a grey zone.  And guy may conclude:  I am going to pursue all leads until I have a mutual agreement of exclusive bf gf, which he may indeed want, or not (right now we do not know).  

BUT:  the dealbreaker is he lied!  He lied.  Full stop.  End of story.  

I would, after I calmed down, maybe a few days or week later, confront him about this, over the phone.  You gotta give him a chance to say his piece.  But, I don’t see any viable excuse.
