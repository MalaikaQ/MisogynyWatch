ldxuy72,1dc8ke8,relationship_advice,electrolitebuzz,"I totally agree that there is a general trend to project personal issues and give drastic advice, especially since... well, it's not your life.

I particularly notice it when it comes to fear of a partner cheating, or in general, jealousy about suspicious friends of the opposite gender. Most commenters jump to the cheating conclusion or come up with allegedly universal rules for not having friends of the opposite gender, not being amicable with exes, and so on. Which, for me, is the definition of toxic control. People are different.

Another topic that is like fire on fuel is the ""boyfriend not proposing"" trend.

Many people also don't really read between the lines – if they read the full post at all and don't detect or take into account very obvious bias from the OP in narrating the story.

All of this said, there are so many stories every day of obvious, textbook emotional and physical abuse, or years-long relationship with a partner who behaves in a blatant disrespectful, childish, unfair way, despite being a full grown adult. Many times, the ""break up"" comments are actually the best advice. It's a reality check that can give you a hard but useful idea of how your relationship looks like to someone who is not deep in the fog as you are. But of course, some deeper analysis and more thoughtful advice is more useful.

Personally, after these 3 years following the subreddit, I find there is often very biased, non-pertinent, drastic advice when it comes to the jealousy/insecurity sphere, but I always see very well written, thoughtful, useful comments when it comes to toxic relationships.",15,2024-07-19 08:11:26,False,Think of the comments as inverted Uber ratings.

lgm7vkh,1dc8ke8,relationship_advice,daisyshwayze,"Really solid points and then there's space for legitimate concern regarding abusive relationships. Basically, the “Power & Control Wheel”, like instances of sexual harassment/ assault, emotional abuse, being intimidated, being isolated, economic abuse, male privilege, gaslighting, being coerced and threatened. These are all very valid abusive behaviors that should be highlighted as such and not pushed into the general consensus of anyone “overreacting”.

I might even argue victims that are still in abusive relationships passively reading those posts and subsequent comments are receiving (recognizing the above listed abusive situations) valid reassurance about their own situation & then leaving without having to post themselves. *On that note, there should be a pinned post with the “Power & Control Wheel”.*

On another note, we're not therapists. So, as much as legal advice is reserved for lawyers, I think relationship advice ideally should come from therapists. This is why the ‘advice’ is biased because most folks on here don't have the proper education to evaluate a situation in depth as well as the mostly singular situations presented here being hard to evaluate even by a therapist (they usually would ask for other instances when this occurred etc).",5,2024-08-05 08:00:40,False,Think of the comments as inverted Uber ratings.

He’s done all the drop offs and pick ups for the kids (I can’t walk right now - without a scooter) and has made dinner every night, and tended to everyone’s needs.
I obviously have been saying thank you and an doing whatever I can so I’m not adding stress, and I don’t abuse his care (like I don’t send him out at midnight for cravings or food).

I think you’re right to be nervous and disappointed in his communication during a serious conversation/topic, as well as him refusing communication (“I don’t want to fight right now”) which causes a lot of emotional backlash onto you. It is okay for him to take a step back when he needs to, but it is NOT okay to ask for that space by lashing out at you and making it seem like you’re the problem. It’s never you vs him, it’s always you together vs the problem.

First of all, two people in the same situation can have two different memories of it. Memory is often wrong. I say this as someone with a Ph.D. In cognitive psychology (human information processing). So, you both could be “telling the truth” as you remember it - and both of you could be wrong if recording of your interactions was available to compare. Eyewitness testimony is a huge area of research for this very reason.

That isn’t the most important thing though.

The important thing I am noticing is that there seems to be NO MUTUAL ADMIRATION in your relationship.

Mutual admiration (which brings with it respect, trust, all those yummy things) is what allows misunderstandings and mistakes to NOT make you implode your relationship. It means when your partner says something you cut them slack. You believe that even if what they did fell flat, their intentions were good.

Since you both seem to be assuming the worst instead of the best in each other, look at that and ask your partner to do the same.",4,2025-08-12 17:36:01,False,"Husband 30M atarted fight after mamogram bad news, I 32F am not sure how to forgive",800,2025-08-12 16:34:05,294,,,,,,[]

n8bqtj0,1moepfg,relationship_advice,Purple-Rose69,"First, my sincere condolences on your loss.  This is a devastating tragedy for you and your family that no one should have to go through. 

Spare your family any further drama and heartache until you know for a fact the baby is your brother’s. 

When the baby is born, get a paternity test with your dna as the comparison.  
Keep this between you and your friend until you get the results.

There are a few things to for you to consider if the baby is your brother’s. I am not sure how it works, but the baby may be entitled to what little social security (as death benefits) that your brother may have had even though he was so young when he passed. Other than that, my guess is there isn’t any estate assets due to his young age, but even so I would expect that after debts (funeral, medical etc) there would be nothing left for the baby.  I bring this up because it would not be unexpected for your friend to ask about it on behalf of the baby.  

If the baby is your brother’s, I would highly suggest that you remain on good terms with your friend if you or anyone in your family want to be a part of the baby’s life.  There is very likely no legal remedies to force visitation — but I do recommend that if this is the case you consult with an attorney to find out any rights your family may have should she deny visitation.  

In the end, at this point, please consider that the baby is innocent and none of us are perfect.  Baby mama is learning a very hard lesson right now and this lesson won’t be over for a very long time. 

Protect your peace, but keep an open mind considering this innocent baby may be your niece or nephew.",142,2025-08-12 10:51:21,False,"My F23 baby brother M19 passed away recently .

For example if your brother was type A blood and the baby’s mother is type O and the baby comes out type B then your brother cannot be the father (barring some rare genetic anomalies.) Any physician can look at the blood types and tell you if they make sense with regard to the presumptive father.

n8dql6o,1moepfg,relationship_advice,erratic_bonsai,"I can tell you feel strongly about this. Unless he had a will, it’s unfortunately not up to your father. The truck and motorcycle legally belong to your brother’s child. Unborn children actually do have inheritance rights, it’s unfortunately common for pregnant women to lose their partners. Now, I can’t imagine that the mother would enforce this and would more likely than not be happy to let your father transfer the title into his name, but I’m going to refer back to the other comment I left. 

You need to be really careful here. The amount of anger you have towards his child’s mother is palpable. It’s clear you are incensed and that she’s your metaphorical punching bag. Do not do anything foolish or premature. If anyone attempts to take possession of any of his belongings or to transfer the title into your father’s name before the estate is settled, you will be, pardon my french, quite fucked in the legal sense. 

Calm down. Get a grief therapist. Recognize that your friend is grieving too and that she does not deserve a single iota of your anger or rage here. Being kind and understanding will get you significantly farther than being standoffish and pissed. You lost your brother. She lost the father of her child. You both are hurting right now, and with the way you’re talking, you are on a path to making it all much worse for everyone. If you treat her with kindness and grieve together rather than adversarially and with blame, you’ll more likely than not get everything you want without a single fight or ounce of pushback.",4,2025-08-12 16:52:24,False,"My F23 baby brother M19 passed away recently .

n8d6rwf,1moepfg,relationship_advice,erratic_bonsai,"No, I mean inherit. Many places have very specific inheritance laws where if someone passes before their parent, any children that person had stand in for them in inheritance law. It’s different from inheriting as a grandchild. In most places grandchildren don’t automatically have inheritance rights, *unless* their parent is dead in which case the *estate* of that dead parent inherits and the beneficiaries of the estate, the grandchildren, inherit the parent’s share. 

Say Alice has three children, Ben, Carl, and Diana. Carl has a son, Edward. Carl dies before Alice, then Alice dies. Edward inherits what Carl would have. 

Or, Alice has three children, Ben, Carl, and Diana. Carl has three children. Carl dies before Alice. Carl’s three children inherit what Carl would have, and split Carl’s share equally amongst them. 

If that’s too confusing just think of it like this—even though the brother is dead, his line on the family tree is still alive and the portion of inheritance he would have been legally entitled to (depending on location) should he have lived will go to the rung directly below him on that family tree.",4,2025-08-12 15:02:19,False,"My F23 baby brother M19 passed away recently .

n8eafyz,1mom2pk,relationship_advice,astonetyger,"Other commenters here have already spoken well to the risks of his controlling behaviour, and this is very important to consider.  This is not healthy behaviour from him, and you may be at risk.  It might be a good time to connect with a professional therapist to help you navigate this safely.

Some other questions to explore here may be:

1. Has anything changed recently in his life? A medical diagnosis or losing his job? Sometimes when people lose control of one part of their lives, they over-compensate in another

2. Has anything happened with you recently?  You said the relationship with him has been good up until now, and this is a change from the norm.  He may perceive changing threats to your safety as you explore the world as a young adult.  

This is what I would call ‘toxic masculine’ expression - again, not a healthy expression, but a prevalent culture here in North America. He may have been taught this is the way a man ‘protects’ his family.

Lastly, some people who invest a lot into being a parent/guardian have SIGNIFICANT trouble letting their children become autonomous adults.

TL;DR - This new behaviour here from him needs to be evaluated. It is not healthy for him or you. A professional therapist could help you figure this out.  You may need to explore another living situation for your safety.

n8fhbxf,1mom2pk,relationship_advice,0xEmmy,"Move out as soon as you can.  Your life depends on it.

Getting picky about who you hang out with, and insisting on personally driving you anytime you leave the house, are major red flags for abuse.  

One of the first steps of establishing a pattern of abuse is micromanaging where you go, and who you're around, so that he can ensure you aren't going anywhere / talking to anyone who can help you get away.

His abuse might not be obvious at first.  When the victim can escape easily, abusers tend to be gentle, careful, and subtle in their actions in order to lull them into a false sense of security, and to ensure that outsiders don't get to see the red flags.  Taking your phone, in addition to (if it's legally your phone) being grounds to call the cops, will make it obvious to everyone that he's controlling you. So instead he monitors it so he'll know if you use it to try to escape, and since your phone doesn't look different, nobody else will know that anything's changed. He knows that if he yells at you in public, people will notice, so instead he yells at you at home. He knows that if he bans you from all your friends at once, people will get suspicious, so instead he bans you from a few at a time. 

Once you're trapped - once he's shut you in and taken your phone - he no longer has a reason to be careful. So he won't be. It's impossible to predict how bad things will get, but even the ""milder"" forms of abuse can seriously and permanently damage your physical and mental health.",1,2025-08-13 00:28:25,False,My (19F) stepfather (44M) has suddenly become more strict and I don’t know why.,185,2025-08-12 14:47:11,196,,,,,,[]

Sometimes being able to hand someone something to read is a really good idea. It’s because it can take the emotion out of it. It allows you to say everything in one go instead of being interrupted. 

While the reverse can also be true, in that people don’t hear your tone of voice and see your body language when they read what you’ve written, that tends to apply to text messages, which are very short, and social media. I really think handing her your post is a good idea, though you may want to print it or hand write it out since she may take offense over your and other people’s comments about how proactive she is or isn’t. 

I also think one suggestion is that she first talks to him alone after the two of you have, and then potentially the three of you talk together. That way what all of you are or are not going to do is said openly. He can’t lie and say it’s not what your mom told him he could do. You get a chance to follow up with questions about why they decided what they did. 

You’re a legal adult now. While to a large degree, as long as you live with them and they support you financially, you need to go by their rules. However. If you are going out with your friends, him trying to say what you can wear isn’t appropriate, especially if he hasn’t done it before. How late you can stay out matters if your coming home past a certain time wakes people up. Who you’re with? Not so much if all it’s just a bad vibe on his part.

What else could it be then? If there was a couple next to him on the train getting busy, he'd have mentioned that, right? But he didn't say that, because there wasn't.

>I confronted him with the words he had said, how he was so turned on because of her when he didn't get turned on by me anymore. To which he replied with basically a word vomit on how he hates himself for not being able to give me the intimacy...

Do you see how non-responsive this is? You confront him with his words that he said, and he turns it around to ""oh but baby, I hate myself for not being able to give you what you need"".

(Also, not for nothing here, he is not trying to give you what you need. He's refused doctors, therapists, everything. If he truly just has a low sex drive, fine. But maybe it's something else. Or maybe he's not attracted to you anymore, but he sure needs to say that. So he's not trying, really.)

This is gaslighting. It's such an overused word, on Reddit and elsewhere, and I wonder how many other times he's done this.

n89uhkq,1mo61r6,relationship_advice,gdrom123,"What he’s doing is gaslighting. He’s making you doubt yourself and second guess what you know is true. He’s lying to avoid accountability, manipulating you, and showing no real love or respect. You’re in shock, and the sunk cost fallacy might trap you into staying. He may even love bomb you so you “forget” what happened.

You don’t know how long this has been going on or with how many people. The woman he was kissing could be another girlfriend or just one of many hookups. Since you’re still intimate, get tested for STDs.

My advice: move on. There’s nothing to salvage. Don’t fall for his lies. He’s a cheater and he’ll do it again or continue as this most likely has been going on for years.

It’s the same feeling when reading yours.

Him getting sober because he realized he fu up does not mean he didn’t cheat or that it was not him.

n8amsnz,1mo61r6,relationship_advice,Human-Walk9801,"I just want to chime in about the intimacy problems.  Y’all are young.  I know it can happen at any time but you’re still in your twenties and there’s no solution in sight.  Do you really see a lifetime with him and no sex as something viable?

I’ve been married for 26 years and together for 28 total.  Sex comes and goes but it’s always there.  If we hit a wall like this my husband wouldn’t stand by and say there’s no cure.  We’d both be working on it to find a way together.  

Beyond the intimacy problems, I really wonder if the fact he’s not interested in you is because he has someone on the side.  Maybe he’s scared to lose you so he’s holding on until he finds someone to branch off to. 

You sat on a 10 minute call listening to him with another woman.  After he declined your first call.  You said yourself this is unusual.  Which means you were interrupting something.  You know his voice and moans.  He was with someone.  I can’t believe that his watch can pick up everything from the sounds of kissing to clothes being moved around from another couple nearby.  If they were that loud and that close he wouldn’t have been able to sleep through it.  He also wouldn’t have been able to decline your first call while sleeping.  

All this to say he can satisfy you he just chooses not to.  Just curious, when he got home did he look disheveled?  Wash his hands? Smell like perfume or lotion? Did he take a shower? I would have stripped him down and investigated after all his gaslighting.  

Sadly,  he’s probably wiped his phone by now.  You’ve got to go by what you’ve heard and make the best choice for you.  There is someone out there that would treat you better.

Here’s how it goes. The MORE you will talk with him, the more he will deny and gaslight. You already have doubts right? Zero concern from him that you heard him cheating? Zero validation of what you said? 

There is another way forward. Speak LESS. Don’t discuss anything about this. When you have spoken to friends, people who are objective, you can ask him one question. 

“Do you want to come clean now?”. 

And say NOTHING else. 

If he keeps gaslighting you, saying things unrelated to it, don’t engage further. And if you can - start slowly planning exit.

He had the nerve to DENY it even with the video in front of him. I called the girl (whom I never blamed, I didn't know her and she didn't know that he had been in a relationship for 5 years... there was a lot of female solidarity). When I told him the things she had told me, he DENIED it again. We were breaking up in a crappy parking lot, and he was denying, denying, denying.

n8b6rlz,1mo61r6,relationship_advice,86pants,"I second this. This actually happened to me when I was 10 weeks pregnant with my now teenager. I called after a late work shift at 2am, my partner accidentally picked up, and I heard him go all the way, even saying “I love you” to the other woman. Just like you, I froze, listened to it all, and couldn’t stop shaking. I ended up forgiving him because of the baby on the way and spent the next five years with him lying, cheating, and emotionally abusing me. I eventually left, but the trauma of that moment stayed and gave me trust issues with every other partner from then on. My best advice: leave. Go to therapy now while it’s still fresh and you have a chance of not letting it set in and turn to stone. You will find a support system, or it will find you once you start living your new life. You deserve better. And the pain is going to be there regardless now.

I was 100% sure it was him during the call but once he got home and we started talking, I kept second guessing myself. He also said he couldn't be intimate at all so how could he be cheating.. i want to believe him but I'm traumatized by what I heard. The more I think about what I heard, the less sure I am it was his voice. I'm clearly a mess right now.

I also agree that a lot of the reasons for me to stay are due to a sunk cost fallacy as we've been together for so long. I also feel unsure I can make it by myself emotionally as i don't have any family in the country I live in, so I can't even leave this house for some time to think about this whole situation. He's been my entire support system for 11 years and I'm mad at myself I got so dependent on him. Not financially, as I have a good job, but overall dependent on his presence or something.

I think you should table the cheating issue for right now, and insist that you begin sex/relationship therapy as a couple and individuals. I think diving into the work needed on your relationship will bring the true issues to light. If he IS cheating, he will already be making exit plans and likely won’t put as much effort into therapy and fixing your relationship. If he shows up and gives it 100%, then even if he did kiss a girl on the train, you guys will likely be in a better place and perhaps that will not feel like such a big deal.

n8e36e5,1mo61r6,relationship_advice,1person_manyviews,I agree with this. I’ve been there and am here. Figuring out a way to leave has been hard but I’ve made my plan to leave and am working on that. Mine took 8 years for me to find out. When I found out ( for sure because I’ve had instances similar to this but not this obvious)… it was so hard on me and our kids. He spazzed out when I found out he was at neighbors house sexing her for 3 years off and on. He left stayed with her a week or 2 belittled me the whole time. Missed our daughters birthday while literally staying up the street at the neighbors… and sent pictures of another kid claiming it was his and he had “responsibilities outside of the home so he couldn’t be there for ours all the time “. I tried to move on although out of my mind she stalking the lady’s house but didn’t let go till he called me with her on the phone to tell me to leave them alone. So he gaslighted me for years while cheating and appearing to be the best family man and boyfriend. After slowly confessing for years his escapades… it has broken me… I hardly recognize myself mentally. You don’t want to go through this. I’m thankful for strength and growth but here we are 4 years later and he may or may not be cheating but it fucks with me that I lost myself in a man who I thought was the best thing ever. I now can’t accept him and his growth. I’m am short tempered and have little patience with him. For anything. He “gave his life to Christ” and I see some major changes. He’s proposed… I just don’t trust that I can truly be fulfilled by someone who was so evil when I was so good to him. I saved his life literally and he still did this to me. When I say he laughed at me finally catching him! Asked me if I wanted a cookie or Grammy for finding out! Mind you he was the sweeeeeeetest kindest man in the world! But his true colors came out and now that I know who he is to his core…. I tried to forgive but don’t think I can forget. We’re engaged. I said yes. But I take this ring off atleast 3 times a year and have canceled wedding plans so often. I was so confident in myself and still have that confidence but Ive compared myself now to all these women he’s cheated with. I’ve not been able to move past this mess. He won’t leave… so I am. We’ve become examples of what I never wanted my kids to witness. Sorry to write so much but I needed to express this…. If the original poster feels she can deal with this… it’ll take therapy or a certain amount of delusion to continue on. But lack of intimacy coupled with cheating sounds like a recipe for disaster. It sounds like he’s using her for something.,1,2025-08-12 18:08:35,False,My boyfriend (32M) picked up my call by accident and I (29F) heard him cheating.

See, if he had always been a stand-up guy who never once tried to gaslight you within the past decade, I might also try to give him the benefit of doubt. But. That doesn’t seem to be the case here. This is a pattern. He’s using a tactic that has worked on you before, and he thinks it may work now.

n8ebqj7,1mo61r6,relationship_advice,afirelullaby,"Im so sorry chicka. He is bad news. I’ve learned the hard way that as soon as a guy behaves in a way that makes you confused, unsure, dismissed, unattractive, frustrated etc. you bring it up once or twice. No more. If nothing changes, he blames you or something still doesn’t feel right; you walk. 

Let me explain why. Women have been sold a lie that we will find happiness and fulfillment through relationship with a man. This is a lie. Disney and media reinforce this. Ever wonder why we are conditioned to accept such low standards from men? This is why. 

If you want to dismantle this conditioning the way forward is; put yourself at the center of your life. Your hopes and dreams and goals are your number one focus and commitment. No more waiting for a man to change to see you or care he is hurting you. No more giving more than he gives you. No more putting up with excuses or a lack of self awareness or accountability. Men know they can string a woman along for years with promises and potential. Do not fall for this. 

If you do this men like this fade away or get dumped because you will refuse to prioritize a man who does not prioritize you. If a grown man can’t be honest, consistent, respectful, engaged and have basic morals and ethics you are better off single.

n8b15ze,1mo61r6,relationship_advice,AstarteOfCaelius,"Yep, in addition to the cheating, *this particular kind* of lying is not only dishonest: but I find it *really* insulting and gross because you *heard* the whole thing. My experience with someone pulling this- I *saw* it. Stood there, watching it happen through a front door window and the entire time, part of me was inwardly screaming at myself to just walk away and I couldn’t. It was like I couldn’t freaking move until by chance, *she* glanced up and saw me. We can just skip the part where they opened the door but, it does involve both of them trying to calm me down- pretty much went Jerry Springer on steroids for what felt like a long time but actually wasn’t. 

Both of them babbling, trying to tell me I didn’t see exactly what I saw. It was infuriating and I was already so angry- but, once the adrenaline started dying down, they *kept trying to lie* and I think a part of you genuinely *wants* to believe that he’s right, and you just imagined it all but, in this type of situation: you never will because you know what you heard. 

And now, you also know that he has no problem lying to you- once you move past the sort of confusion-hope-but *nah* part: you start thinking about the *other* situations you brushed off over and over. 

It makes you feel crazy and disoriented- think about how you feel OP. Would you willingly make someone you love feel like *that*? I mean cheating is bad enough- but really consider that. If he *doesn’t* stick with this lie, be ready for a less ridiculous set of lies- because if he’s got a brain in his head *at all*, that’s his next move. 

If I had to guess, he will go with the same stuff as you put in here regarding your intimacy miss match and somehow, someway- even though he’ll be all kinds of self deprecating about it: it’ll be your fault, somehow. Cheaters *always* do that when they can’t just deny.

Save yourself a *lot* of trouble and cut him off entirely.

Edit: I should also mention that the part where you start wondering about other things you brushed off? Happens worse if you stay *and* you start seeing lies all the time.

But you didn't respect the decisions she's made for her life and the life of her child, and you forced her to think about and talk about something that is obviously painful for her to remember.

You failed to protect her when she was a child, and you've failed to respect her wishes to protect herself and her child as an adult. How much more pain will be necessary for you to learn to respect your daughter as an autonomous adult?

Even when she was an adult, you acted as a flying monkey for him, fighting your daughter ""tooth and nail"" to get your dad invited to her wedding, even though she's now an adult and well within her rights to cut him out for any reason and it's not your business to prevent her from doing so or even get involved. 


How long have you been fighting your daughter on your father's behalf? It sounds like it's been years.


I'm glad you've finally realised what's happened and your eyes have been opened. To repair the relationship with her, you must stop defending your father to her. Do not try to get involved between them. Don't try and reconcile them. 


If your daughter is ok with talking more with you, I'd ask her what you did to make her think you knew about his actions and did nothing. She clearly feels you enabled him. And I believe you didn't know. But you did something that made her feel you did know and turned a blind eye. You need to find out what that was so you can avoid ever doing it again. 


I would recommend therapy for yourself to come to terms with this betrayal from him. Because he clearly is a dangerous predator who was hiding in plain sight and that calls a lot of things into question about your own judgement and ability to be manipulated. 


I'm really sorry that you have a predator for a father. It sounds like he's harmed multiple people here. Your daughter the most.

n87qvh7,1mnsj0s,relationship_advice,redplaidpurpleplaid,"I am going to say some harsh things you may not be ready to fully take in yet. 

You sound like a woman who was trained from an early age to ignore your own instincts, shield men from accountability, and do everything to maintain the family image. You fought to have your daughter's grandfather invited to the wedding because ""we are going to put on the appearance of a happy family, no matter what"" and also probably some component of appeasing him, too. You rationalized/minimized your daughter's childhood symptoms because to pay attention to them and ask her questions, and treat her as a valid source of information about herself (rather than you making all the assumptions about her) would have caused you to violate your survival programming.

You say you love your daughter very much, and on one level that's probably true, but when it comes right down to it, up until now, she's the one who got sacrificed in order for you to continue to carry out your programming.

Yes, I know, this is survival for women under patriarchy, and I have compassion for you for that. But that doesn't mean you get to avoid accountability for how it impacted your daughter. You will now need to choose who to be loyal to. Your father, or your daughter. You cannot have both. 

Your fear that ""the family will implode"" if you tell your father you know what he did and you are no longer speaking to him, I suspect it is not fear that your daughter will blame herself, she sounds clearer on all of this than you are. I think it's your own fear for your own self, terrified to violate the programming by holding a male abuser accountable. 

I don't really have any advice for what to do right now, but others have already suggested support hotlines and therapy, both of which are basically a necessity for you at this point. You need support for the shock of finding this out about your father, too.

Go to therapy to figure out your behaviour in this.

Personally, I think your daughter should not allow her grandfather near her child. Even if supervised.

Now you know and you need to cut him out of your life for the horrific things he did to your baby girl. 

And tell everyone else in the family. Because predators like him don't stop and he undoubtedly has also abused other children. Sexual abuse in multiple generations can be the basis for extensive mental illness in a family. And other members of your family may also be child sexual abusers.

SA is very complicated. There's often a high level of coercion that makes you feel like you invited the sexual advances, which also brings a HIGH level of shame.

But you also feel protective and like you don't want to cause more conflict in your family (I came from a high conflict family and was a peace keeper).

n87nini,1mnsj0s,relationship_advice,silmaril94,"PARENTS AND “SAFE ADULTS” —NORMALIZE BELIEVING CHILDREN WHEN THEY TELL YOU SOMETHING IS HAPPENING TO THEM

I’m so sick of hearing stories similar to this across various subreddits. I wasn’t CSA’d but I was severely emotionally abused, dealt with alcoholism and other substance abuse from caregivers, had my developmental needs ignored, and was medically neglected (ask me about my ruptured eardrum because my parents said I was “exaggerating” my earache pain until I didn’t stop screaming for 3 hours and they finally brought me to the emergency room). NO ADULT in my life ever helped me, there is more to the story but the bottom line is I was hurt for my entire childhood and no one ever helped me and I had to spend many years as an adult overcoming that trauma. The adults had all the power and I had none, I was supposed to “suck it up”, endure harm, and then “get over it” on my own once I left the house.

When adult children want to GO AGAINST ALL BIOLOGICAL HUMAN PROGRAMMING FOR COMMUNITY AND CONNECTION by cutting off a close family member (this includes the so-called “trend” of some Gen-Z going NC with parents, which I believe is the current generation having the guts to implement a long-overdue reckoning with society’s politely hidden evils) there is ALWAYS A REASON, usually one the rest of the family did their best to ignore at the child’s detriment so they could avoid the uncomfortable social and familial consequences.

The QUESTION you need to ask yourself NOW is will you join your daughter in breaking the cycle of intergenerational trauma, or will you side with Dirty Ol’ Granpa and sweep it under the rug to “keep the peace” in your fucked up family",11,2025-08-11 18:14:12,False,My (52F) daughter (32F) had a baby recently and gave me horrifying news.

n87br98,1mnsj0s,relationship_advice,Liberty4All357,"I'm sorry you're having to come to terms with this. I can't imagine having to deal with such a situation. 

For the record, old men are not ""just assholes."" Some old men are assholes, and some aren't. And don't assume the ones that are assholes would never sexually assault someone in a vulnerable place if given the chance. Assholes love to do harmful things to other people... and the only limit to what they'd do is what they think they can get away with without suffering too much consequence.

As far as what to do, first off I think you should apologize profusely to your daughter for forcing her to have someone at her wedding that she clearly did not want there. Regardless of whether or not she was a SA survivor... that's messed up. You should also let her know how much you hurt for her and whatever she suffered at your dad's hands. Don't tell her you're having trouble coming to terms with your father being a child molester. That's for you to deal with. She has dealt with enough and obviously has already come to terms with the fact that your dad is a monster. It would probably be a good idea to offer to pay for her to get therapy too, if she hasn't already. 

Frankly, I think the best case would be that she gets enough therapy to be able to talk about this to the police and ultimately bring charges to have him put in prison until he dies. Instead, in this country at least, if they brag about it proudly enough and it is proved to a jury that they did it... this nation goes full protectionist and makes them President.

my family has a history of mental illness, and cycles of trauma. i've, unfortunately, been the one to have to work my mom through her trauma. trauma she didn't even realize was all that bad, but she hurt me growing up because of it, without realizing. i was actually abused by her worse than i thought, and me and my therapist have come to the conclusion that it was quite literally by accident. my therapist ethically cannot lie to me lol, so i do stand by this.

i don't know your daughter, i don't know how she feels. but me personally, i love my mom. she always tried to do her best for me, even though she fucked up pretty badly. that doesn't take away from the fact that she hurt me, though. that pain sits in me, and it's hard to know what to do with it when i can't write it off as something done to me on purpose. the fact that your daughter still speaks to you says SOMETHING to me about her feelings on your role in all this. she's hurt, but if she truly hated you and thought this was all unsalvageable, you wouldn't still be in her life.

my mom feels so guilty about the ways i was hurt growing up, her brain convinced her that none of it happened. those memories were erased because her brain wanted to save her from the pain of feeling guilty. at least that's how it seems to me.

i wish, so badly, that my mom would go to therapy. it's a heavy burden to have to walk your parents through every emotion, tell them how to fix things for you. sometimes the hurt runs so deep, there's no knowing what someone should do for me.

it might sound like a big jump, but i honestly, truly think you should find a therapist to help guide you through this. therapy is more than sitting on a couch and telling freud about your childhood. you talk to a psychology professional about situations you're in and they can help you figure out a personalized plan of action. i recommend finding a therapist who lists sexual trauma as one of their specialties. they will have a better understanding of what your daughter might need from you right now.

and honestly, you're going through a lot yourself right now. yes, you did fuck up. there is no changing the past. the only thing you can control is what you do from here on out. you're dealing with deep parental guilt, confusion on how you either didn't know or blocked out previous memories, and the fact that your father is capable of this. i noticed that you called him ""her grandfather"" for the bulk of the post, as opposed to your dad. i mention this because it seems to me like you're having an extremely hard time connecting this as something your dad could do. calling him ""her grandfather"" is your brain protecting you from the bombshell that your dad has done horrible things. that is lifechanging information.

this situation is messy and awful for both of you. but your emotions CANNOT fall onto your daughter's plate. it's your responsibility to navigate this on your own the best you can for her. and i truly believe the best course of action is to find a therapist to help you process your emotions, and figure out how to help your daughter. it's okay to need help and advice right now. a professional with experience in dealing with sexual trauma should be a GREAT person to help you figure out what to do for her, and how to process your own emotions here too. you don't have to go through this alone.

people block out memories that cause them great pain. i never would've imagined that i'd blocked out traumatic memories, but i've been in therapy unearthing things i hadn't thought about in YEARS. if you've blocked out any clues this was happening, it's likely your brain has used that strategy for other traumas in your past as well. you might remember things about your dad that you'd forgotten. you might remember things about your childhood. i really, REALLY recommend getting a therapist to help you navigate this.

again, some replies here are gonna be from some angry and hurt people. but making you feel like shit isn't going to fix anything. it's time to DO something.",7,2025-08-11 17:47:51,False,My (52F) daughter (32F) had a baby recently and gave me horrifying news.

I say this from experience. My dad told me that if I said anything to my mom, she’d get mad at me. In a way, he was right. When I told her as an adult, she shamed me for not telling her as a child and accused me of leading him on. I was six years old at the time.

n8822lk,1mnsj0s,relationship_advice,Meowmaowmiaow,"First of all, you need to apologise to your daughter. Genuinely, from the heart. 

“I’m so sorry that he was able to hurt you like that, and that I didn’t acknowledge the signs. I’m sorry that I’ve pushed so hard to try and have him be a part of your life without considering there was a much deeper reason to why you didn’t want him around. I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable or unsafe, and I don’t want to make you relive that. I promise I won’t ever try to bring him around you again, or around your child.” 

Secondly, you need therapy. You need to learn how to deal with this information, and how to support her, from a professional. Therapy doesn’t mean you’re broken, it means you need extra help figuring stuff out, and there is nothing braver than admitting you need that. 

Third, I’d ask her if she’d like to attend a couple sessions with you. Create a better understanding between you two, and give her a safe environment to work through things as a team - because it’s likely she holds some resentment over you pushing for him to be in her life.

Fourth, do NOT share this information without her consent. If you feel the need to protect an at risk individual, speak to their parent, and say he has harmed “someone”. Do not name names unless she would like the family to know. Do not give details. This is her trauma, and it’s not your job to put it on display. 

When I was 14, I was brutally raped by my then partner. I left him. I had told one person, and that person chose to tell everyone, every single detail of what he did to me, to “protect them”. 5 years later, it still follows me around. People look at me as if I’m fragile or broken, or they think I lied about it, and treat me like filth. You never escape that gossip. Don’t do it to your daughter. 

The other thing I will add - be gentle with her right now. After you apologise (over text may be best) ask her if there’s anything she needs that she’d like you to do for her, or if she’d like some space. Respect her answer. This is going to be a really tense time in your relationship with your daughter, so you need to let her decide the pace things go “back to normal” at. 

Also, just in case you’re feeling down about yourself - you did not fail her, you are not a bad person over this, and you CAN come back from this.

Talk to a therapist. You’ve been crying for hours. I get the hurt of being a parent and finding out your child was harmed. But you need to refocus on HER.  The victim. Your daughter. A parent figures out how to be strong for their kid when their kid is hurting. Talk to a therapist to deal with your guilt. 

Then talk to your daughter to ask her what looks like support from you. Apologize for not asking deeper questions about her hate towards her grandfather. Apologize for not being a safe person to go to. Vow to listen to her. Vow to be a vault for your secrets (minus maybe therapy so tell her that). 

You cannot share her story without talking to her. You can step in and ensure grandpa isn’t alone with kids. And you can look for other kids who are acting out and find out if grandpas actions got passed down to other people in the family and have been swept under the table.

You have a LOT of work to do if you ever want to gain her trust.

You describe the behaviors of an abused child screaming for help, and pointing you directly to the person she needed kept away from her, didn't invite him to her wedding, you yourself admit that you FOUGHT her to force her to allow her abuser to be at her wedding, you continue to shut her up and invalidate her lived experience, and you have the fucking *gall* to act aggrieved like this situation is somehow about you or happening to you.

You dropped the ball. You failed as a parent. If you'd like to stop contributing to the further complex trauma your daughter is actively experiencing, fucking take action. Stop pretending things are fine, stop giving free passes to abusers by pretending that men are just assholes, 'they can't help it, we can't expect anything else from them, the burden is on women to clean up after their abuses' is fucking bullshit.

Cut your father off. Find out from your daughter how you *begin* to start to make it up to her - that you didn't believe her, that you dismissed her, that you shushed her objections and steamrolled her decisions, never once stopping to inquire why your father was such an abhorrent person.

Swallow your need to sweep everything under the rug hoping they'll go away. Process your own emotions with a therapist, and do not bring any self pitying energy into conversations about this with your daughter. You have a lot of things you need to process here, seeing as you've refused for decades to admit there was a problem to deal with, and you need to be a strong person who is supporting your daughter as you attempt to help her heal from this damage.

You can grieve and fall apart on your own and with your own support system, but your daughter is not one of them for this situation. You need to hear the ways she is angry and hurt by your inaction, and not put your feelings onto her. You need to hear her fear, and shame, and hurt, that you spent all this time pretending didn't exist or that was an inconvenience for you.

You're going to have to face that you did wrong, and that she's right to be angry with you. If you ever hope to have a healthy, loving relationship with your daughter, you need to face what you've done, and be active in helping her heal, letting her take the lead.

For instance, she tried not to have her rapist at her wedding, and you forced her to allow him to be there. You have to sit with that knowledge for the rest of your life. And she's right to be upset with you about it for as long as that feeling lasts in her.

You fucked up. You have to live with that. In order to help your daughter heal and move forward in life, you need to take ownership of your failures as a parent, change the way you treat your daughter, and do what *she* needs you to do to help her heal.

You can start with a sincere and detailed apology, which you should then follow up with actively listening to anything she has to say.",5,2025-08-11 18:18:27,False,My (52F) daughter (32F) had a baby recently and gave me horrifying news. TW: SA,8779,2025-08-11 16:18:50,533,,,,,,[]

It’s not your place to tell anyone else. 

It’s normal to feel the way you do, to cry so hard for your daughter and the fact that you have guilt over not being able to understand her cries for help.

It sounds like you’re beginning your journey to be more self aware and to eventually re-build your relationship with your daughter.

One thing you need to realize is that part of being trauma informed is letting your daughter have control. Don’t ask her about it again. She will talk to you if or when she is ready.

n87wn4y,1mnsj0s,relationship_advice,RogueSlytherin,"OP, you are the most naive SOB I’ve had the displeasure of coming across (at least this week, it is Reddit). You say “she’s always had conflict with her grandfather”. That’s not normal, at all. What 6 year old randomly has beef with PopPop? Something bad happened, and, from the sounds of things, I’d be shocked if it wasn’t sexual in nature. The fact that the specific rule is not being allowed to be alone with the child, and not about safety or unacceptable language should tell you everything you need to know. Why else would that be her most important rule and why would it only apply to him? 

You have been so unbelievably obstinate with respect to your father’s behavior that you are invalidating her feelings constantly. Why would she ever open up to you about her disdain for him when you CONSTANTLY refuse to listen to her? What difference does it make to you whether he can be alone with the baby? If he really is at the end of his life, he should never be left alone with an infant for the safety of both parties. So, with all of this being said, why are you angling for your father to be alone with that baby? What kind of father are you?!? And isn’t it enough for him to be able to meet his great grandchild? Why isn’t that sufficient for you?

OP, you had best sit back and zip it. Keep this up and your father won’t be the only one without a relationship with the baby. The fact that your daughter is allowing him anywhere near her baby is more than I would allow. You’ve clearly not been the most invested parent for the last three decades. This girl has done everything but play “pin the tail on where he touched you”. She shouldn’t have to spell it out and you don’t need a reason to respect her boundaries.

n87g6za,1mnsj0s,relationship_advice,JoyfulSong246,"From the perspective of someone who went through being abused (verbally and emotionally) by a family member in my childhood I would like to point out a few things.

First, if you tolerated him treating your daughter or others badly and excused it in any way (“he’s just an asshole”) then likely your daughter thought that anything else he did you’d excuse the same way.

Second, I was abused at home, with my parents at home. I really thought they knew. After various conversations as an adult, they didn’t. They DID excuse some things they saw (“they’re just kids!). But my brother was clever and the worst stuff he did behind their backs.

So BOTH things can be true. Maybe (maybe) you didn’t know the depths of what was going on, but your daughter really thought you did and were excusing it.

She doesn't want to speak about it, she is a victim but it seems, based on the description of her reaction, that she feels ashamed of what happened, don't add to her suffering by doing something against her will. Victims of SA often blame themselves and feel a lot of guilt, shame and anger. Don't victimize her again. 

I don't know what age did the SA begin or for how long it went, was she so young that she couldn't explain clearly? It was one time or it happened for years? What did he say or do that threaten her into silence? Can you answer any of these questions?

Usually young victims can't express well what they went through, they don't understand what is happening, they only know that the aggressor is an adult, and adults should be reliable especially those that are family. Maybe she tried to tell you but couldn't explain it clearly, maybe she was so young that believed that you must have known ( because mothers know everything) maybe the predator threatened her or you ... But independently of what happened in the past, don't do anything against your daughter's will and now it's not the time to bring it up, let her rest and make sure everyone follows her rules because  postpartum is stressful enough without the adding drama

n87khw0,1mnsj0s,relationship_advice,RamblingReflections,"That’s the part that stuck out for me too. That poor woman, having her wedding essentially ruined by having to see someone she’d gone out of her way to avoid and *not* see for years, right there on what was supposed to be *her* day!

If indeed she believes her mum knew about the abuse (whether or not OP did actually know, the daughter thinks she did), daughter then had to endure OP fighting for grandad to be at the wedding, I’m extremely surprised the daughter talks to OP at all. 

I would have been ropable if I thought my mum knowingly fought for, and was successful in, getting my abuser in to witness what should have been the happiest day of my life.   

I hope OP’s daughter got the support she needed to heal, even if she had to do it without her mum’s help. All OP can do now is believe, support, and actually listen to, her daughter. 

The rest of this is directed to OP: Whether or not you knew OP, your daughter believes you did, or at least that you should have known. That’s valid. Don’t invalidate her further, and please accept that she can truthfully believe you did know, or should have known, at the same time as you can also truthfully believe she didn’t tell you, or that you had little reason to join the dots together before now. 

Don’t make her feel she’s being gaslit by trying to push your belief that she didn’t tell you. Apologise for not noticing, and ask her what she needs of you, and follow through with what she asks. As bad as you’re feeling now, this isn’t about you. As bad as you’re feeling now, she felt worse, and also probably spent many hours sobbing. The difference is she was a *child*. You’re devastated as an adult upon finding out a parent isn’t who you thought they were. Imagine the devastation of finding the same thing out as a child? 

Not only was your daughter abused, but at the same time this was happening, she was also coming to terms with the fact that her mum, who she relied on for protection, wasn’t the person who was going to be able to provide that protection for her, for whatever reason. 

So yeah, this is about your daughter and her wants and needs going forward, first and foremost. I’m very sorry you and her are going though this, and I hope I didn’t sound too harsh, I’m just trying to open your eyes to see that how you choose to act in the coming days and weeks will define your relationship with your daughter and granddaughter for the rest of your life.",104,2025-08-11 17:55:54,False,My (52F) daughter (32F) had a baby recently and gave me horrifying news.

He had a really fucked up childhood because his dad and his paternal grandfather were an absolute terrors.  Like, people in the town they lived close to hated them.  My dad had one mentally handicapped older brother that I never met because back then you could hide people you were embarrassed about, two sisters about his age who are both messed up in the head, and a much younger brother that I actually suspect kill their father.

While me and my brother were growing up, he was the best father anyone could ever possible ask for.  Worked hard, but also spent a ton of time with sports and camping with my brother and me.

Then we move out and he basically loses it.  Drinking gets out of control, starts doing drugs, then him and my mom separate because who could live with that, and he starts womanizing.  Eventually gets in a fight with one of his lady friends and ends up in the hospital having been beaten with a hammer because he was too scared of hurting her, and died from his injuries.

Me and my brother both have two grown kids that we're proud of, and it seems like our dad broke that chain, even if it got him in the end.",382,2025-08-11 18:28:39,False,My (52F) daughter (32F) had a baby recently and gave me horrifying news. TW: SA,8779,2025-08-11 16:18:50,533,,,,,,[]

First off, I never suggested that a child or adult cannot block out their SA. 

We're talking about an accusation of rape made by a child, to a parent.

> they can later fully believe that it never happened

""IT"" is the accusation of child rape. 

Believing that the child fabulated the accusation and that the rape never happened is not the same as forgetting the accusation. You're arguing against something I did not claim.

Made up or not, there is no way a parent (of otherwise normal mental health) *forgets that their child made a rape accusation*. The parents who ""forget"" are liars who are trying to insulate themselves from accountability when the rape claim is later shown to be true or highly probable. It is self-serving to claim that their child never told them of the rape. The assertion that the child never made the accusation -- when the child clearly remembers it -- is an intentional falsehood stated with for the purpose of deception. 

The child has nothing to gain by reminding the parent of the accusation. The parent has everything to lose by admitting that they heard the accusation and did nothing.",-21,2025-08-11 18:39:42,False,My (52F) daughter (32F) had a baby recently and gave me horrifying news.

What you should be doing is sitting down with her IMMEDIATELY and saying ""I believe you and I'm so sorry I didn't listen and protect you when you needed me most."" Don't try to excuse or rationalize his behavior or your own. Tell her she never has to be around him again and you will do everything in your power to make sure he isn't in contact with other children who could potentially be abused.

n87ri6f,1mnsj0s,relationship_advice,UniqueOctopus05,"I think it’s important to remember that people respond to things differently though. You can’t walk up to your daughter like 2 weeks after she’s given birth and demand she talk to you about her CSA. I agree that OP shouldn’t assume anything and should let her daughter know she is willing to talk, but I think it’s right that OP is waiting to talk to her daughter to decide how to proceed. She already said she believed her daughter. And she has clearly taken time to process it herself without involving her daughter (which is good). But if she is truly committed to trying to heal this wound between them imo she should find out how her daughter wants her to react first and act according to this. Imagine she cuts the dad off and the family harasses the daughter (a vulnerable new mother !) to find out why. OP has to actually find out how her daughter feels first.

And like depending on the person asking them how they want you to handle it is kind of unfair too because you’re placing the onus of your decision on them. You want to let them know you are willing to do whatever it takes to try to make them feel comfortable again but you also have to ask them how involved they even want to be.

n87u21t,1mnsj0s,relationship_advice,UniqueOctopus05,"Just to say if I told my mother about this and this is how she reacted I would never speak to her again. Everyone is different. And something like this is just another version of prioritising yourself over the victim. Turning him over to the police without even talking to your adult child about how they want to proceed is insane. If OP talks to her daughter and she tells OP she doesn’t want her to cut off her grandfather but the OP feels she cannot see him again then of course that is her right. But to do this without first considering the victim’s desires or autonomy is ridiculous.

You can’t presume to know the right way to react to something like this. Especially after you’ve just been told something that proves you clearly don’t know your child nearly as well as you thought you did. Whether it is for the daughter’s sake or to satisfy your own need for vengeance, it’s just another way of taking away the victim’s control over her life and her trauma etc. It’s a violation of the trust someone puts in you when they disclose something like this.

And for the daughter to have to hear that her mother beat up her grandfather and reported him to the police? While she’s trying to navigate new motherhood and connect with her baby? That’s just insanely selfish. Like not even giving her time to decide if/when she wants to talk about it or what she wants her mother to do about it. What if she wants to preserve the sanctity of her first few months of motherhood without having her assault dredged up? What is she wants to heal from having a child or any postpartum effects before talking about it? You have to take the victim’s cue.

Either you literally just don’t understand how memory-formation and retention works, or you’re tripling-down because your worldview requires people to exist as either “good” or “evil.”

Memories can get blocked out. Memories can be altered involuntarily.

No, but it does help provide an explanation more reasonable than “OP has been covering this up for decades, is gaslighting her daughter, and now decided to anonymously gaslight strangers on reddit for no reason other than fake internet points.”

OP doesn’t have to be entirely-evil or entirely-innocent. Maybe they brushed it off initially (a *bad* thing to do), but have since forgotten it (neither good nor bad … it’s just the way our flawed brains work.) 

I know the world seems easier to navigate when it’s good vs evil, but you’re cheating yourself out of a richer understanding of what it means to be a human being by taking that shortcut.

n885hq6,1mnsj0s,relationship_advice,UniqueOctopus05,"Yeah, I take your point. But her daughter is an adult. A traumatised adult but still an adult with the freedom to make her own decisions. The daughter has just told OP about a gross violation of her autonomy and you want her to respond by violating her autonomy again by forcing her to handle things a certain way? After she’s just been made aware that she hasn’t known what’s best for her daughter for quite a while? And the daughter has just given birth? There’s a fair chance that the only reason the daughter told her is to make absolutely sure her ab*ser could not access her child – for OP to take this as an invitation to talk about it wouldn’t be fair imo. Given the fact that she failed to protect her from the abuse in the first place, it’s pretty bold to assume that her daughter is interested in discussing it with her – I don’t necessarily think that the daughter doesn’t want to discuss it, but for OP to assume that she does would be presumptuous imo. And for OP to ask her daughter to process her trauma on anything less than her own terms would be crazy in my opinion.

ALSO, I get what you’re saying about letting her daughter walk away – but I’m not so sure that the first questions/thoughts/reactions of someone who has just been told their daughter was assaulted by their father are really something you want a CSA victim to hear. Like, maybe some people need to hear that to know they are truly cared about. But it seems to me that the risk that all that emotion and questioning and processing registers with the victim as a lack of support/belief or reaffirms their sense of guilt far outweighs the potential benefits.

Anyways, I wasn’t defending OP or suggesting that she shouldn’t talk to her daughter! I just think that OP should talk to her daughter before she makes any decisions on how to proceed. And that she should prioritise her daughter’s autonomy over her desire/need to process the information. I’m not suggesting she wait for the daughter to reach out to her and cry out for help again. But given what OP says her daughter actually said to her, I really think all she should do is tell her daughter she is ready to talk when she wants to. Because even if talking sooner is what is better, any version of a response that involves bypassing the daughter’s decisions is kind of a slap in the face. It wouldn’t be fair for OP to assume that she knows what is best/right for her daughter or to assume that she is even capable of validating her daughter in that way anymore. I’m not saying you’re wrong per se, I just think OP (and other parents that have failed their children) needs to recognise that once you fail your child in this way you kind of lose the right to tell them that you know what is best for them.

Basically – it isn’t that I was saying OP should ignore it. Just that I think she needs to give her daughter full control over the situation and act according to what her daughter wants from her (e.g. does she want her to act as proxy between her and the rest of her family, does she want to tell her what happened, does she want her to stay away for a bit until she feels ready to get back in touch, etc)",0,2025-08-11 20:05:02,False,My (52F) daughter (32F) had a baby recently and gave me horrifying news.

In my view you spent 20k USD to avoid marrying someone who can’t think for herself and into a family that’s dysfunctional and toxic.

Let’s say, had you got over the approval part and got married. Did you expect the interference and the control they exert on her to diminish or stop?

I think you dodged a bullet and the only mistake you can make now is to go ahead with the marriage in case she flip-flops again.

Take the 20k loss as a learning (like a trading loss)…. and frankly you are too young to commit to something as a big as marriage right now.

This is one of the big pivots though. Yes, it is an escape... but she isn't ready for that. I don't doubt she loves you but that doesn't mean love is strong enough to break free of a lifetime of parental conditioning and family peer pressure. I really do think it is all about the family but I worry it also paints a pretty clear picture that it will always be about the family. I think you know it will never be enough, nothing she ever does will truly be approved, no amount of distance she ever tries to establish will ever be healthy for her because she will never be able to let them go and it's clear they don't want to let her go either. 

And honestly, you have to get very real about what that means for a life with her. Forget just processing the pain of this absolute mess right now, this is likely always going to be the case.

Calling off the wedding 30 days before is insane.

I am actively trading and “working” my savings if that is what you mean; mostly through options contracts and other investment avenues.

From what you’ve described, this isn’t just about a one-time mistake. It’s about:
	•	Prolonged deception (she was involved with someone else for half your relationship).
	•	Repeated dishonesty (swearing to you she never cheated).
	•	Emotional manipulation (framing her actions as stemming from your stoicism rather than her choices).
	•	Using gifts you gave her in intimate moments with another person, which adds another layer of hurt.


Bottom line:
This isn’t about whether she regrets it or whether she “really loves you.” It’s about whether you can ever feel safe and respected with her again. From the facts, she has shown she’s capable of deep, long-term deceit. Even if forgiveness were possible, rebuilding trust after this scale of betrayal is rarely sustainable.

n8evdr3,1mosnbj,relationship_advice,zSlyz,"Hey OP

I’m a little confused by the timeline in your post.  What I’m getting is:

1) you’ve been dating for 4 years
2) she cheated on you during years 2 and 3 (alternate relationship)
3) you proposed to her (giving her a ring and smart watch)
4) she sent you a video of her being with her side piece
5) you’ve taken back the ring and smashed the smartwatch you gave her as tokens of your love.
6) you said don’t call me, I’ll call you

Is that about right?

Her excuse for having the side “D” is that she wasn’t sure if you were serious?  Does that mean that you were dating but not official?  Did you ever talk to her about your relationship?

Way I see it is one of either:
1) you guys weren’t official and never discussed your relationship status during that 2 year period, or
2) she’s a lying, cheating 304 and you’re better off without her.

You also have 2 options:
1) restart your relationship from scratch, like the previous 4 years was with a different person. Or
2) go cold turkey, block her on everything and focus on yourself for a few months.  Work, exercise, play sport, make new friends, rekindle old friendships, go back packing or camping, travel. Basically anything to get your head back right.

1. He lies

n8c1c3d,1mogw21,relationship_advice,GameboyPATH,"If you're already in a position where you feel ready to break up with him, I'm not here to tell you otherwise. Different people have different standards for what's necessary for them to trust their partner. If you have a history of having difficulty trusting your partner based on his unexplained (or inconsistent) behaviors, and this one just happens to be the straw that breaks the camel's back, you're free to bounce.

Generally speaking, though, my advice for ""my partner says/does something that leaves me feeling confused and concerned"" is typically this: ""talk to your goddamn partner about it.""

If his texts don't line up with what he's told you about not being attracted to anyone else, tell him so.

If your sex isn't satisfying, tell him so, and offer to work with him on improving it.

If you happen upon a blonde hair, and you don't know what it's doing in his room, ask him.

If you're snooping through his personal shit and happen across sexual items... well, you *can* tell him you violated his personal privacy and you want an explanation for something he'd understandably want to keep private even if he's not cheating on you... but he may not exactly be forthcoming with the truth. Ideally, the best time to have had an honest talk with him about your feelings was before you snooped.

But again, that's all overall best practices on how to maturely cope with feelings of insecurity and distrust. If your trust in him has run out, you're free to bail, but you could theoretically still talk to him, if you feel like there's a chance that reassurance and context from him could help you feel prepared to trust him again.",11,2025-08-12 11:41:09,False,I (29F) found something suspicious in my boyfriend’s (30M) closet.

n8cxza1,1mol1ja,relationship_advice,GameboyPATH,"I'm sorry to hear you're going through that. A lot of what I'm going to say may be blunt, but I do feel for you.

Alcohol isn't going to help you cope. It's just going to bottle up your feelings (so to speak), and make it difficult to unpack them later on when you're more removed from the incident. Not to mention, even if it *did* work, you'd just be replacing one problem with another: alcohol dependence.

Other things you can do to process your emotions:

* Talk things out to yourself in private, or to an inanimate object

* Talk things out with someone you know and trust, like a friend or family member

* Cry

* Shout into a pillow

* Convey your emotions into a creative work of art - music, writing, poetry, visual arts, sculpture, whatever you need.

* Write in a journal - this comes with the added benefit of letting you reflect on past entries later on

It also helps to try and stick to a regular schedule, minimizing how much this breakup disrupts your day-to-day life.

>the more I see what she’s doing the more I realize I never really knew her.

You're recognizing that continuing to stay in the loop on what she's up to is hurting you. I totally get and understand how you'd be seeking out information and context about this incident, or perhaps you're just used to wanting to know what her thoughts and feelings are. But there's no sense in exposing yourself to stimulus that just hurts you more.

As for your friends, I'd say this is the optimal time to stay in touch with them. You're going through a difficult time, and could use support. Consider friends or family members who you know and trust, and would be willing to talk to about your troubles. It's important to have a social network when you're going through a difficult time, and getting cheated on is absolutely a difficult time.",2,2025-08-12 14:18:00,False,I broke up with girl that cheated on me.

So you have no confidence the child is yours. Nor can you be confident that she will be faithful once the baby is born.

  
She sounds BPD or NPD. Either way you can't marry her. You can write her parents a letter outlining your view of the facts but most likely they won't believe you. So don't get your hopes up.

  
You're doing the best in a very bad situation. Hopefully the baby isn't yours and you can move past and forget about her,eventually.

Then if you are arguing and ""saying things you don't mean in the moment"" (which is usually when you do say things you mean deep down) that's going to make her feel unsafe, which then puts sex off the table.

So I think sex is the wrong thing to focus on. Would you be happily married to her just as she is, career, travel, family, socially and any other way? If not, divorce lets her and you find someone suitable. Because this isn't about sex, it's about compatability.

It can also help with emotions, reduce stress, and strengthen the bond between partners.

n8ffml8,1moxda7,relationship_advice,Akasha250,"Interesting. You expected her to adapt your goals and values, why didn't you expect to meet somewhere in the middle? Or just agree to disagree. 

Generally sex is important for a happy marriage if it's important for at least one of the persons involved. Her not really being interested in trying to fix your sex life usually means one of two things, either she's not that into sex generally, or she's not that much into sex with you. Which kind of begs the question how she experiences sex. ​

You not insisting on sex is basically the lowest bar. You're basically reassuring her you're not going to rape her. Like, good, but why did that need clarification in the first place. 

I'm pretty sure you're not from a western country, so I'm unsure what role parents usually play in divorces where your live. If they decide that, it sounds like it's very much decided.

- you want longer sex and she wants shorter sex. Why does it now become “she doesn’t want to have sex with me” instead of you also trying to compromise and making it shorter and more enjoyable for her?

The real issue here is the sexual dysfunction. 2-3 times a month isn't outrageous 2-3 years into a relationship, but one party consistently ""feeling overwhelmed"" after orgasm and then checking out is not a recipe for long term happiness. It's worth having a serious discussion over. At bare minimum you have grounds to assert that your feelings and needs aren't being taken fully into account.

n8b6cui,1mo7hsd,relationship_advice,violue,"Some thoughts:

1. I'm really sorry you're going through this. Sometimes it's really just bad luck. I mean you can do everything ""right"" with a partner and still have it turn out like shit. I don't say this to dissuade you from dating, but so you understand that it doesn't automatically mean this is your fault, or something you need to ""fix"" about yourself. 

2. I know it must feel like you've wasted the past 8 months, but try not to see it that way. Think about the things you gained from the relationship. Hobbies you picked up because of your time together, or music you discovered, things you learned about yourself, things you learned are important to you in a romantic relationship. 

3. If you're willing, you might consider talking to a counselor about this. You're still at a fairly formative age, especially with this being your second relationship. This experience could cause you to ""over correct"" by having sex way before you're comfortable, or cause you to be absolutely terrified of bringing a relationship to that level. 

4. If you do finally hear from him, be careful about letting your relief color your judgment. If he comes back with some half-baked excuse, you might find yourself willing to accept it because it sort of ""erases"" the rejection you've been feeling. Don't do that. Remember how this made you feel, and remind yourself that you deserve better. Unless he can show proof he's been in a coma or held for ransom, don't entertain his excuses.",8,2025-08-12 09:11:03,False,24F Ghosted by a 25M guy I was seeing for 8 months after we had sex.

And it's possible the fear of those expectations that go with relationships caused him to buckle and ghost because he realized he wanted to sleep with you but he didn't want to be your boyfriend.

n8datqg,1mo7hsd,relationship_advice,sunshineparadox_,"Thank you! It’s rough Ngl. I had to relearn to talk and write because a stroke followed from low oxygen. There wasn’t an available provider with speech language therapy, and I couldn’t do it online because I couldn’t remember. I didn’t always remember my birthday. It took three years to get to where I was, but I wouldn’t be here without some of my college professors - ironically I took coursework in neurolinguistics which covers aphasia - my family, the doctors who did help, close friends. I lost a lot of people but the people who did stick around? I can never repay them. Although I’d have done it for them in a heartbeat too. 

I got sick right after two of my cats died (05/21, 09/21, 01/22), and we adopted a sweet girl who unintentionally looked like the two we lost combined. I saw one of the cats in my coma actually, not just my dad. It gave me peace.

Actually writing all that out, I thought I had given up on the idea of community. It was a value but I didn’t think it existed anymore. But remembering back, I did have one. A strong one. 

Thank you for asking both for your kindness but also because it made me reflect on what I have still, not what I lost.

n8bos6f,1moei30,relationship_advice,Whitehouses_,"He doesn’t just want “to talk”. He wants you to give him permission to cheat. And he’s going to keep bothering you until you do. Or until you snap. 

He’s full of shit. Not just about that, but about all men finding sex as a purely mechanical and non-intimate need that doesn’t involve any kind of emotion or feelings. It’s such extreme bollocks, in fact, that I can only think that he said it as an excuse for him wanting to screw other women. “See? It wouldn’t mean anything, darling.” 

I also bet it’s such extreme bollocks that if *you* expressed an equal desire to go outside your marriage to do the same, he’d flip out. 

People outgrow each other in marriages. Particularly when they marry young. I imagine that if you tell him you’re not agreeable to opening your marriage, or letting him shag other people, or whatever it is he actually means when he talks about being “curious”, he’ll just do it behind your back anyway. Or he’ll beg and nag and resent you forever. Or you’ll say ok just for a bit of peace, and then *you’ll* feel resentful and hurt and unwanted forever. 

There’s no solution to this besides giving each other the freedom to live as you want to. I imagine he’ll realise pretty quickly that the grass is far from greener, but I also think that you’ll discover a whole new world of peace and freedom and independence that you will not want to give up again.

n8dr6ae,1moei30,relationship_advice,Evrydyguy,"From guy to guy sex can be something different. We are not all the same. Sex isn’t transactional between my wife and I. We both feel heard, desired, and loved. We have plenty of sex and together we work to ensure both of us are taken care of.

When I was younger I dreamt of multiple partners, threesomes, and one night stands. It was pretty common for guys to feel and want that. It still seems like that’s the case.

Usually when it happens someone becomes insecure and the main relationship falls apart. The primary couple stops connecting and bonding. The secondary relationship drains the energy. It’s usually too late when this is realized.

My working theory on men is that we seek attention. Typically this is sexual in nature with a hint of wanting to be desired. We face a brain fog of sorts when our sexual appetite isn’t met. However that appetite is gluttonous. We will gorge ourself with a feast or famine mentality. During this brain fog as well we act a fool.

It isn’t until later on in our lives when we are mature enough to look inward into ourselves. To allow ourself to heal our real problems. To stop trying to fill our void inside of pain, loneliness, and sadness.

Whatever you do don’t do the open relationship unless you want to. Unless you’re comfortable sharing. It’s not easy. It can be fun for some but that is a very small percentage. Keep it just you two. If he needs that then divorce.

Secondly, but more importantly, you should absolutely be able to talk about your sexual interests and desires with your partner without shame. Even if their interests are not shared, being able to express those vulnerabilities/desires in a safe place is super helpful.

For example: one partner may want to explore a bdsm Dynamic but the other is primarily ""vanilla."" This is a great opportunity to discuss sexual boundaries, trust, safety, hard/soft limits, and possibly incorporate some aspects of the more experimental partners interests into the bedroom in ways that benefit the vanilla partner AND respect their autonomy. 

You can do some research into your partner's interests together and that is a great opportunity to bond. You're also free to express your desires. This allows you to switch it up and be more vocal about your needs.

n8fghw3,1moei30,relationship_advice,No_Noise_851,"There are plenty of men and women who are like that. His claim about “all men” is certainly bullshit.
I’d say a single man is far more likely to engage in transactional, meaningless sex just to get off. In my opinion this is far more common in the 18-35ish range (for some it’s til’ death do we part).
I was this way occasionally in my mid twenties and early thirties, and by far more willing to.

I’d say that 25-30% of men don’t find it appealing or view it as purely transactional with no emotional significance, some 40-50% will once or twice, and the remaining 20-35%, sex is just sex and the person means nothing.

The real dogs tend to bark most often and loudest and give the rest a bad name. 35-40 years old and I think most are past this and are looking for real connection.

I was about 31-32 years old the last time I had meaningless sex with a woman. As an almost 44M, I can say that it is absolutely not appealing to me anymore. I’ve been with my gf for  2 years now. We were kinda one of those rare cases where we just instantly clicked on so many levels and different little things from music taste, to food, religion or lack thereof, how materialistic we are or aren’t. We have fun, and enjoy each others company whether we’re out hiking, bowling, grocery shopping, working on our cars or painting the house. We can sit or lay quietly for hours without a word and be completely content. Just happy to be together. I do love her very much, I’m far more in love and at peace with her than any other time in my life with anyone else. We have just enough size difference (height) that we fit together laying on the couch or in bed perfectly…no awkwardness or fighting for position or anything. Every time as soon as we’re skin to skin, everything is just…perfect. Every time.
Our sexual chemistry is off the charts. 2 years in and we can’t get enough of each other and I swear each and every time it’s just a little better. We both experienced the most intense orgasm ever…ever ever together like 2 weeks ago. We both climax together 80-85% of the time and every single time. She usually has multiple orgasms..3-7 is really common. Just so good heh.

It’s kinda crazy…never have I been so comfortable, so attracted to a woman or so very much in love with her. Nothing comes close.

Anything from her that sounds like pain, or sadness or worry or anger and I’m a limp noodle until she’s back in a good headspace. My emotions play a huge part in the quality.

Bad behavior or not, the genesis of men’s negative feelings towards a long term partner about sex stems from them not seeing any attraction cues coming from that partner.

It breeds deep sadness, then frustration just because of the physiological effects of not exercising those natural emotional/physical sex “muscles”.   We see all manner of responses to this in partnerships, but many high libido people harden their responses to the lower libido partner in an effort to take the sting out of the persistent rejection.   Understanding this and addressing it directly generally goes a long way towards helping the higher libido partner continue to feel valued and sought after.   It may seem like you’re coddling him because of his problem sexual wants/desires, but what you’re really doing is showing him that he’s valued and wanted by you.

n8e5mlr,1moqf44,relationship_advice,DrewIsaque,"So this is what happens….and tbh there’s no rational explanation to any of what you’re saying she doing other than she’s with another guy. She agreed to be in a committed and serious relationship. So once she agreed to that she shouldn’t be moving like she is…very secretive and hiding things. Very weird. 

She definitely met someone else and testing him out but wants to keep you warm in case he doesn’t work out. This other guy is probably her ideal type and checks off all her boxes, but at the same time that guy is probably known as an F boy so she’s seeing if she can change him. At same time she wants to keep you as a plan b. That’s why she hasn’t ended things with you yet. They for sure hooked up together. Women have a hard time hooking up with two guys at the same time and showing the same energy for both. She’s likely feeling him more and just sees you as a placeholder in case her actual type doesn’t work out. Women are hypergamous in nature. They are always in the lookout for the better suitor 

I would tell her straight up it’s better you two go back to just dating, situationship, friends with benefits, or w/e  title yall had before. Then start dating other women and going out more with your friends. If you can’t return to what yall had before because your feelings are too deep than step away completely. Block her number and all socials. Just quit her cold turkey. Focus on yourself and work on further improving yourself physically, mentally, spiritually, and financially.

Here's the thing. You ask if she's still seeing other people. If she says no, you either trust her or you don't. If you don't trust her answer (based on that huge chunk of text I didn't read, I'm guessing you have good reasons not to) then you have decisions to make.   
  
Do you not trust her because of your baggage? Seek help.   
Do you not trust her because she's not trustworthy? Seek a new relationship.

Marking their territory/seeing you again - yeah women do that, you'll get used to it.

>At the 3 week mark we had a discussion about being exclusive and off hinge. She brought it up.

Very early. Should have been cautious.

>she has stopped being as engaging over text and now doesn’t text me in the evening or mention what she was doing, we used to talk about our day, she’d say stuff about missing me and stealing the covers, none of it now…all of these things she did before

Emotional withdrawal is something you should take a strong note of.

>she wouldn’t let me follow her on Instagram at first

Ah, now we might be seeing the other side. A little too much emotional investment from you perhaps? Why are you chasing for her socials? She should be chasing for yours.

>we have a trip planned for later this month, when her coworker asked her about it she made a face and shook her head, she didn’t think I noticed

Hmm. Not a great sign.

>she hides her phone and goes to the bathroom to send texts

Red. Flag.

I’ve responded to a few key points that stood out, not all of them. Honestly, I wouldn’t date this girl. Some things might be coincidences, but put it all together - it’s not good. Infidelity aside, is this really someone who respects their partner? I wouldn’t accept that behavior.

That said, you need to look at yourself here. You’ve likely entered exclusivity with someone you’ve only known for three weeks. Plus, it sounds like you’ve been pretty needy - asking for her Instagram, following her every move -that shows you’re way more invested than she is. I bet you’ve also done things you haven’t mentioned - your messaging style, how you talk. That signal neediness. Women pick up on that much more than men do.

If I had to guess: she was interested because you’re older and seemed confident and masculine. But you quickly fell into her traps - developed feelings, agreed to exclusivity too soon, got needy, started mate guarding, and so on. All this signals insecurity, not confidence.

Confident, masculine men don’t hand out exclusivity easily. They make girls work for it. They don’t get jealous or paranoid because they know they can replace a girl easily. Because you showed neediness, she lost attraction and now sees you as a “schmuck.” So she’s hunting for a truly confident man.

Understand this: at 24, these girls know confident, masculine men well. They’ve been with them before and can smell insecurity a mile away. They test you, and in this case, you failed.",0,2025-08-12 18:32:30,False,I 28M think she’s 24F still seeing other people. How do I confront her?,15,2025-08-12 17:52:14,35,,,,,,[]

n8ex8gs,1mouh77,relationship_advice,Restoriust,"Love is a daily decision. If he feels things are fine and nothing is wrong then that means he has a lower base maintenance than you. With a kid in the mix and 10 years of time invested, I suggest that you sit him down and explain literally all of this. That you feel like it’s always you instigating change, that when he does _____ you feel amazing and when he does _____ you feel distant and that you need him to keep up with it. 

I understand he has a habit of falling back into a rut. Lots of relationships do. That’s normal. But ask yourself; with him always ALWAYS being in your life and with you loving him so dearly, do you want to choose love or do you want to give up because love can be hard? Yes. He should pinch himself and realize you’re backing away. But he may literally just be fine with things being stable and calm and not hectic. He will 10000% be worse off without you so I hope you understand he does truthfully love you. 

Counseling for a situation like yours is something I’d suggest you add 3 month and 6 month check ins for. He may just need reminders in a neutral space that isn’t coming from you. And from you specifically he may need the truth about how dire this is. Guys are weird though. If they see things get better they sometimes assume the problem is solved and go back to baseline.

What are these needs? Are they new needs or are they recently developed? 

I think you should try a different marriage counselor. If you go on YT or Tik Tok there are lots of videos with women voicing very similar nebulous complaints about their man failing to ""meet their needs"". 

So they get rid of him,he gets a new,younger replacement and they freak out. Because,from their viewpoint,that isn't fair. They were supposed to be the one getting a new & improved replacement. They were the ones living their authentic life but no new guy has presented himself to take on her ""need meeting"" responsibilities. 

  
Because nobody wants a middle aged woman with a child who blew up her family in search of whatever they weren't getting from their husband.

  
Seriously,do you think the next guy is just going to magically be who you want him to?

Go ahead, leave your man and child. But don't expect some other guy to take his place. Because a wise man will know what you did to your husband you will eventually do to him.",1,2025-08-12 23:52:51,False,How do you (F35) leave someone (M37) when nothing is amiss.,9,2025-08-12 21:07:19,17,,,,,,[]

She already expressed she just wants to leave all custody to me and leave the kids with me... but I don't think she would actually go through with that. I'm okay with it either way, but I just don't think it'll happen like that and she will change her mind.

She's already making it hard on the kids many days.. being short with them, using sour attitude, etc and dumped the fact that we're separating mentioning it randomly one night multiple times, me finding out with my oldest coming to me crying and confused to which I calmed him down and got him into bed.

I'm completely willing to support her financially. It won't be easy currently, but I've been putting in countless hours up until 3-6AM working after kids are sleeping on my business to be able to scale and double my finances. So hopefully it's doable. 

It's taking a heavy toll on me as it is... honestly I think I'm getting sick/physical issues from how tense and worried I am all the time.. multiple times I've gotten cramps in my heart area and I'm pretty worried.. almost fainted once from it all so I'm definitely past my point of being able to handle this and have tried everything so far that I possibly can. 

I had similar thinking for many years so far that it would be more to lose and mess up the kids... I went through it too and never wanted my kids to have to go through this. It's at the point though where I've tried everything and improved our life to a very comfortable state but the issues still persist. 

Thanks for the advice and taking the time to read it.

It feels as though you are treading water to keep the afloat and your wife is at the end of her tether. 

I think your wife needs an urgent mental health assessment. Being a mother is hard but very few mothers will want to leave their children.

Post child birth women's hormones can change to the point they don't even want to be touched, and get moody easily. Your Mrs needs to have her hormones checked and treatment should be available for it. Depression is also a suspect here and that can also be treated. You need to make sure your wife gets medical help.

Rest and a break sounds like you both need some down time. This includes a night off with the kids being minded by someone.

Good call on the hormones, you really hit the nail on the head there. I'll try to get her to get that checked up on with some sort of a full physical... doctors here are so shoddy with that stuff and rarely find much unless it's something clear and concrete from their standard tests.

Our kids have been doing sleep overs, so we've had the time and nights to ourselves. She just goes on her phone for hours on end so I just end up working or playing video games. Have made effort to try to cook with her, find things to do... but she's just not into it.

She knows I want this to work, I tell her I love her often.. pick flowers for her, help tend to her garden, do stuff around the house to help her, tell her she's beautiful, and I clearly voiced to her that I have wanted to make it work.. a happy family has been my dream and literally written in my hopes and dreams of my high school grad book. It's at a point now though with her episodes that I just can't take it anymore and my body is giving me signs with the tension/heart aches. She hates gifts or surprises.. so I tell her lets go shopping but she only wants to thrift shop. I've learned gifts aren't a good thing with her and she has told me not to multiple times... all holidays are a very hard and challenging time and a mental melt down or episode is expected. (again stemming from childhood trauma and never believing she's worthy at this point or deserves it...)

Going away for a weekend alone sounds nice... but I fear rejection as she's already expressed clearly she wants out (it's been multiple times over the years).

At this point I just want to get her all the possible help I can to help her get back on her feet, then maybe re-evaluate after we get out of this rut of mental health issues and like you said, hormones. I've been trying every possible angle I can to help her before considering depression medication as that stuff has it's own set of challenges.. and trying to help her learn coping mechanisms instead but it's not working.

n8esz06,1mot5ip,relationship_advice,Any_Requirement_8562,"I’m going to add a new thought that I haven’t seen yet. Only because you used the term, “degrading”. 

I want to start by saying, there is no way you’re alone, and you should never feel pressured to participate in a sexual act that you don’t enjoy. Sex is to be enjoyed by both people- and nothing about sex should feel forced, or not enjoyable. Sex is the one act that should not have a negative correlation associated with it! So good on you for advocating for your needs and being open about your boundaries with him. 

My additional thought for you is this: sexual acts are a highly subjective experience, based mostly on impressions we develop along the way- some even when we are small and hearing our societal influences speak about themselves or others. 
Because oral sex is not an objective or inherently degrading act but it is your experience with it, it makes me wonder if this could have something to do with trauma, shame or guilt surrounding your sexuality growing up. 

When I was small, I was raised extremely religious. I felt shame surrounding many many things- to include being a sexual being. I hid it, I felt dirty, I felt so much shame. When I started questioning why I felt this way…because I didn’t like feeling that way, I realized that everything I was taught was the belief of an organization, not my own. Through that original thought I was able to move through my impressions and decide for myself what I actually felt.

So if I don’t like participating in something, I am now free of impressions ruling my reasons- and I simply don’t like it because I don’t like it. It doesn’t need a negative association anymore. 

All of that to say, if you don’t like oral, you don’t like oral and that is perfectly ok! I just wanted to share my experience because “degrading” was a part of my own impression-system surrounding sex, and now I participate whole heartedly in acts I would have never thought I would, and I enjoy it thoroughly lol.

n8eyffd,1mot5ip,relationship_advice,Gray221B,"You're definitely not loco or by any means alone in your feelings on the matter. I've seen on Reddit the question posed regarding how you would feel if oral was off the table. While there were plenty of people for whom it would be a dealbreaker, there were also plenty of men currently in this situation who, while disappointed, loved their partners enough that they were willing to go without. In the first several years of exploring my sexuality, I too found both giving and receiving oral gross and degrading. There are plenty of women who are grossed out by the taste of semen. Besides, I guarantee the percentage of men who refuse to perform oral is larger than that of women, which is disgraceful considering 70% of women need more than PIV sex in order to achieve orgasm.

Someone needs to tell your guy there's nothing about a grown ass man pouting like a little child that makes women more likely to want to go down on him. And occasionally giving in is like feeding a dog from the table. Once they get a taste they never stop begging. Instead of just turning him down in the moment almost every time, you probably need to have a conversation about this outside the bedroom where you explicitly explain to him that you find giving oral sex degrading and don't want to ever do it at all. Period. If he can't accept that then he's not the man for you.

I understand not wanting to be made to feel like you're only good for sex, but would you feel the same way if a partner didn't want to have any form of sex at all?

Right after she mentioned it being a degrading act, she said the act itself is the problematic part because it’s not fun or enjoyable. In either direction—receiving or giving.

That’s the most important bit, but I also want to add that even if a person doesn’t have any personal negative association, they aren’t obligated to give someone a blowjob. Also, having aversions to the common ways that oral is treated by things from language to media to other aspects of society does not preclude someone from having an aversion to the act itself on a physical level as well as that mental aspect.

Also, while oral sex may not be inherently degrading, the colloquial language in English certainly occasionally positions it as degrading. It equally positions several other sexual things as meaningful outside an actually sexual context, such as getting fucked, being a pussy, having balls, being a dickrider, and so on. That doesn’t mean that a person is being degraded by engaging in anything sexual in ways that are spoken about degradingly by people.  But it does mean that there is some level of common association that has nothing to do with one own’s sexuality, trauma, and upbringing, when people use phrases like “cocksucker” to disparage someone to the point where we can define it. It most often has much less to do with personal sexuality and more to do with how society speaks about it even in the theoretical sense, simply using language. Most of that is just patriarchal. Obviously there’s a relationship between a lot of what you said about sexual repression and societal acceptance of certain phrases as usable and logical in their colloquial meanings. 

But that doesn’t mean that personally “freeing yourself” makes society’s impressions and thus how people around you wield language, any different. Even if you realize that you personally don’t have to feel ashamed of sucking dick, that doesn’t mean society won’t treat people who suck dick in a degrading way. It’s entirely fair and understandable to interpret that it feels degrading based on how other people use the act or reference it to degrade.",4,2025-08-12 22:26:37,False,"I’m a 29f my bf is 31m & I don’t enjoy giving or receiving oral, am I alone?",6,2025-08-12 20:00:16,73,,,,,,[]

Second, if you aren't comfortable with any aspect of non-monogamy, don't.  Nonmonogamy can work well in a very health relationship where both people are fully comfortable with the idea, but it will *almost never* work well if there isn't a healthy relationship to begin with.

Third, you CAN divorce and remain ... actual roommates.  I know a couple who did it for quite a while for financial reasons; there's no reason why you can't do it for the kids, even if you could afford two places.

You could also end the romantic/sexual part of the relationship and not legally divorce, but the potential for being messier is a lot higher there.",9,2025-08-12 15:52:40,False,"Married (35M/35F) with kids - partner wants poly, I don't. Try it or separate?",17,2025-08-12 15:13:21,150,,,,,,[]

You want to model what true love looks like to your children. The bright side is that you guys are great co-parents together & once you figure out schedules & whatnot, they’ll have a fine upbringing. You’ll have to go through a learning process, but as long as you maintain mutual respect for each other, you’ll model something really healthy for your children. You’re also teaching your children that they should never settle. They should seek someone who really loves them, & if the person they love doesn’t treat them the way they want to be treated, you’re showing them that it’s ok to walk away. That you’ll end up ok. You’ll still end up happy. & you’ll still probably find the real love of your life.

n8dvn36,1momq8b,relationship_advice,DanoGKid,"I suspect you’re hearing from a lot of monogamous folks in this channel. It would probably be wise to post your question in a poly channel, to get an informed take on it. 

I didn’t read your post *super* closely, but I do know enough about poly relationships to understand that you generally have to start with a really strong basis of communication, equal footing, all parties willing, and really solid ground rules. Your situation doesn’t really seem like that… but you really should run this past some folks who know of whence they speak to get a true pulse on this.

In my first marriage, my spouse wanted to open the relationship, but that was really about disengaging from the primary relationship and funneling all energy in that direction, instead of putting energy into improving the marriage. With predictable results. 

(Back story: When I finally acquiesced, I had two hard lines in the sand. 1) If you’re gonna do it, then you need to know that I’m gonna do it too — because I sensed an assumption that this was going to be a lopsided, one-way arrangement, and I wanted to be clear that I wouldn’t be a doormat and there wasn’t going to be a double standard. 2) If this is how it’s going to be, that’s fine — but my expectation is that it is going to be handled in the way of the time-honored French tradition: with discretion. “You can do what you want to, but I don’t want to know about it.” Approximately five minutes later, the side dating began, and it wasn’t long before the hickies arrived. Seriously. Yes, *that* juvenile. Here, I need to add that I was not surprised, but I also was not crushed: for further context, the marriage was pretty much already dead, and the only reason I finally acquiesced was that I knew it was probably unsalvageable anyway, and I wanted to understand whether, as a woman then in my early 40s, I had any prospects — because back then I was more afraid of being alone than staying with an abusive partner. It didn’t take long for me to figure out that there was a world full of kinder people who would find me desirable. It also didn’t take long for the hickies to arrive at my dining room table. I said, “You can’t even manage to be discreet. There’s nothing left but coparenting,” and the instantaneous reply, without missing a single beat, was, “We should lead separate lives.” In that moment, everything crystallized for me. I was done begging someone who didn’t want to be with me to stay. And that was that, 20 years, over. Honestly, it was a relief not to have somebody who was perpetually angry stomping around all the time. Obviously not the same as your situation, but all of this to say, mine was a good example of what a true polyamorous relationship is *not,* because neither party was acting in good faith. But there *are* ways of acting in good faith. I’m just not sure whether what your wife is asking for is one of them.

n8eh1p3,1momq8b,relationship_advice,Archangel1962,"> and we’re surprisingly good now.

No, you’re not.  If you were she wouldn’t be looking to fuck other guys.

And I get you want to protect your kids, but they’ll struggle just as much, if not more, in a home where they see their father as being blatantly unhappy.  And what kind of example are you setting for the kids with mommy and/or daddy having boyfriends/girlfriends.

This is something she should have brought up when you were trying to decide whether to stay together or not, not after she decided to start again with you.  She obviously enjoyed getting dicked down during your year apart and she still wants that while enjoying the safety and stability of marriage to you.  That’s not polyamory, that’s just wanting her cake and eating it too.

She has feelings for this guy but he won’t leave his wife.  So she’s getting what she can from him.  Meanwhile she’s treating you as the backup plan.  The fact she won’t contemplate closing the marriage again, not even temporarily shows you that you are not her primary concern and she doesn’t treat the marriage as the primary relationship.

Don’t do it.  You’ll be miserable the entire time and the way these things go the marriage will almost certainly end anyway.  So save yourself months, if not years of unhappiness and end it now.  Concentrate on yourself and your kids for a while and hopefully someone will come into your life for whom you will be all they need.",2,2025-08-12 19:33:51,False,"Married (35M/35F) with kids - partner wants poly, I don't.

n8emevb,1momq8b,relationship_advice,indigochild143,"Okay. I can’t tell you what to do but I can share my experience!

I entered a “poly” relationship with a married couple a few years back and this is how it went.

I put poly in quotations because it was very similar to this. His wife cheated on more than one occasion, and eventually came to the idea they should open their marriage. Initially only she went and dated and he didn’t feel good about it at all. 

Eventually he started opening up and going on dates. 

Him and I knew each other from years back, as I was great friends with his sister. 

We just so happened to both move across the country and be living in the same state again about  ten ish years later, that’s when I saw him again and we went on a date and they explained their situation etc. 

They really marketed themselves so well. They were so “therapized” if you will. She worked in mental health, they were so open about previous struggles and even their struggles when they first opened their relationship. But they truly convinced themselves and each other this was healthy. 

As time went on I started to realize how incredibly unhealthy the dynamic was despite lying to themselves. It was incredibly toxic, possessive, but in a very passive aggressive, non confrontational way. It was ICKY!

I eventually started to catch on to her ways. 

She was calculated, manipulative, and lacked empathy for his feelings and I was so in love with him I couldn’t watch it anymore. 

I left and removed myself and told him I was worried about him (as was his entire family who she tried to excommunicate him from and what little friends he had in that state, becuase of her).

Long story longer, after I left, he had an epiphany and separated from her, eventually moved out and filed for divorce. 

There were SO many things he was so blind to.. she took such advantage of him. It was truly so sad.

That’s the condensed version but.. all of this to say: I understand not every poly relationship is like this. But when one partner brings in polyamory to the relationship to be able to get what they want it usually never ends well. 

Unless both people are open to and feel excited to explore polyamory, and be willing to be objective, accountable and honest, there is no room for success in polyamory.

I think you know deep down what you need to do. 

I wish you the best my friend.",2,2025-08-12 20:09:15,False,"Married (35M/35F) with kids - partner wants poly, I don't. Try it or separate?",17,2025-08-12 15:13:21,150,,,,,,[]

n8eczxi,1momq8b,relationship_advice,WhenToLaff7789,"I am going to break this to you: in polyamory people incorrectly assume you obtain multiple partners. What you actually gain is the ability to hold space for more than one relationship whatever form it presents to you. Your wife seems to be actively seeking connections. And you seem to be prioritising the need to keep the family structure intact above all. Between these two, I see no sustainable way by which poly love can exist… yet.

I would suggest you pay close attention to how you are feeling… your panic clearly states that you do not trust your wife. And your wife is unable to witness your predicament because she has escaped into the fantasy of her new connection. Possibly because dealing with the heaviness that exists in your relationship is too difficult for her right now? 

Now I am not placing a judgement on your wife and her past discretions if at all. I am just saying this does not sound like an ideal space for your children to thrive.

n8dv9js,1mol6qb,relationship_advice,nispe2,"Okay, well, first things first. Chlamydia is easily treatable, so wait a few weeks, retest, and everyone who's infected should be treated.


False positives do occur (so it's possible but improbable she's not positive now, especially after a retest). False negatives do occur, so it's possible but improbable she wasn't negative in 2023. It's also possible you're a false negative now. Samples can be mixed up (which is usually why they require a second test using a different sample and method), but that is unlikely, too, with the retest.


Cheating is the obvious answer to how she got it, but ask yourself this: did she need to tell you? Could she have taken her meds and left you to fend for yourself? If so, then the fact that she came forward should really stack the deck in favor of her being as confused as you are.


Keep in mind that, if she hasn't cheated, she has all the same suspicions about you that you have about her.


You don't need to break up with her if she cheated, but also, you don't need to stay with her if she's been faithful. If you can't find a way to resolve the distrust, then your relationship is doomed, whether someone has cheated or not. So work on resolving the distrust, not Sherlock Holmesing her vagina.",12,2025-08-12 17:20:29,False,My 25f gf tested positive for chlamydia m26,20,2025-08-12 14:12:56,50,,,,,,[]

n8dhsku,1mol6qb,relationship_advice,Efficient-Shower-627,"I can’t say what your gf did but I can speak from my own experience because it has actually happened to me twice. Now… neither time was it as long as 2 years. But still it was sketchy and I felt like no one believed me when I truly was faithful. Anyways, first time, I tested positive after only having sex exclusively with someone about 6 times. They were negative. It still sketched me (and them) out because it seems like they would have gotten it one of those six times. 

Second time, different person. We had been dating and having sex exclusively for about 3 or 4 months and I tested positive. They tested negative. Again very shocked. 

Anyways, from my personal experience I can say that this CAN happen while your gf is being loyal to you. 2 years is a much longer time to not contract it than what happened in my experience but I’d think it’s still positive. Honestly, you could probably ask your doctor for their opinion. Mine said it was possible, but unlikely… but happened obviously. 

From the obsessive research I did at the time I learned that women catch STDs a lot easier than men do. So it could be possible, especially if she didn’t have any symptoms, that she didn’t pass it to you. Also, I don’t know if you’ve been on any antibiotics in the past 2 years. But there could be a chance that you had it, cured it, and then haven’t caught it back. 

The only part I can’t relate to or completely understand is that she was tested before you guys got together and it was negative. Because I was not tested before becoming exclusive in either of the relationships I referred to. So that is a bit of a red flag but… like some of the other commenters have said, may still be possible. 

If I were you I would go to your doctor and get tested again and tell them EVERYTHING. And ask if it’s possible and how likely it would be if so. Because if they tell you, yeah it’s maybe possible, but not very likely… then that’s a good sign you need to get out of there.",3,2025-08-12 16:02:13,False,My 25f gf tested positive for chlamydia m26,20,2025-08-12 14:12:56,50,,,,,,[]

n8cfwo0,1mog44q,relationship_advice,Aware_Ambassador4098,"I think ""too soon"" is relative. When you're both in your 30s I would expect the time needed to decide whether you want to marry them to be much shorter, perhaps a couple years. In your thirties you have more insight, a better understanding of what you want or don't want in a partner, and you can recognize red/green flags much faster from experience.

I began dating my husband when I was 32 and he was 27, he moved in very early into the relationship, by the 6th month I knew I would marry him and he proposed on our 10th month. We got married in less than 2 years. Though it worked for us I know that this is not typical and might not work for everyone.

In your case though there seems to be no sensible reason as to why you should wait more. Living together for 4,5 years, travelling, owning pets all sound like you are already living like a married couple. 6 years together at age 32 with no apparent major issue is definitely a reasonable and even expected time for a proposal. You are not asking for too much my friend. He seems reluctant and the fact that he couldn't even come up with a real reason for waiting is also quite telling.

One more thing to consider is that men have no time pressure when it comes to marriage and kids, whereas we unfortunately have a ticking biological clock. I've seen way too many examples like this where men in long term relationships just want to keep the status quo because it is convenient for them. If you really do want kids one day, let this be a reminder to you that sticking around and waiting for years for him to 'be ready' is NOT your only option.",1,2025-08-12 12:49:51,False,I (32f) have been with my boyfriend (33m) for six years.

n8cl0xd,1moiuvn,relationship_advice,T00narmy1,"Reality check? Girl, if you have to EXPLAIN to a 35 year old ADULT what it means to have mental burn out and to need space/time alone, then you are dating a man-child. What adult doesn't understand burnout and the need for space?

But the thing about your post that sent ALARM BELLS ringing, is your hesitation to tell him. I know that feeling, I recognized it immediately. YOU ARE SCARED TO TELL HIM. You know he won't understand and then he'll argue with you about your own mental state, making your mental state worse.  And this: ""I’m nervous he’ll hold it against me (sometimes that happens with things here and there) **because** I canceled last Friday (due to what I think was my first migraine!) and wasn’t able to see him Sunday."" Girl, that is not how relationships work. You are in a TOXIC relationship if you are nervous. I sometimes get migraines. I also like a certain amount of ""alone time"" a month for mental overload issues. My partner doesn't hold ANYTHING against me. He's supportive. He's understanding. He shows compassion and love. He can be disappointed but will say something like, ""It's okay. It's disappointing that we won't get to see each other, but it's more important that you take care of yourself. I'll miss you but it will make it that much better when I see you next week!"" or something similar. Can you spot the difference?

Your bf is making everything about himself. He doesn't care how you feel, he only cares how it affects him. If you are NERVOUS to tell your partner how you feel (not even about HIM!) - that you are feeling stressed with work, and you are nervous to tell him because you know he'll be resentful and hold it against you, then you have bigger issues in your relationship, IMO.

The answer is you just tell him, and if he reacts poorly, you dump him for being self absorbed and immature. That is the answer. You state what you need and why, clearly. If he's not supportive, and tries to argue with you, walk away from it and then start thinking about whether this relationship is even serving you anymore.",13,2025-08-12 13:14:35,False,How do I (35F) Explain to my BF (34M) I’m Too Mentally Drained to Hang Out This Week?,15,2025-08-12 12:45:58,32,,,,,,[]

What does this mean?

> how can I express my need for alone time (despite whether or not I am feeling physically healthy) without him feeling upset or annoyed?

**You can't**. You cannot, nor should you, attempt to control or police the emotions of your partner. 

The way that your BF feels and the way that he reacts to things are not your responsibility. If he is going to be upset that you need alone time, then there's no specific phrasing or magic spell that will make him somehow not upset. He will be upset by the fact that he can't see you, not the fact that you phrased it a specific way. 

All that being said, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't express your needs and the fact that you're 35 years old and unable to advocate for yourself within a serious relationship is a huge issue.

Out of curiosity, what is it about your relationship that makes it difficult for you to put yourself first? Does your BF say things that implies he doesn't care about your needs? Is it just general anxiety about being too needy? What's the deal?",1,2025-08-12 17:33:57,False,How do I (35F) Explain to my BF (34M) I’m Too Mentally Drained to Hang Out This Week?,15,2025-08-12 12:45:58,32,,,,,,[]

n886kl6,1mnwt92,relationship_advice,MirrorHappy4918,"Hi,

I am from a South Asian background myself and can understand the context very well. This mother-son dynamic you described is something that is quite common in South Asian families. I have a family friend whose husband is cold and distant and verbally abusive. Hence, she never got the husband of her dreams. Especially if it was arranged marriage, she had no say in the matter. So, she raised her son to be “her dream man” and is emotionally dependant on her. When he first told her that he has a girlfriend, the mom was very happy. She was from the same background. However, over time, the son had to divide his time between his mom and girlfriend. The mom did not like that and grew to resent the girlfriend and her family. This shows that it’s not really about the culture. Even if it, it’s probably because she feels like of your wife were also to be Indian, she would have more control over your relationship and more influence. 

You are at a crossroads here with two options: upsetting your mom or resenting her for the rest of your life. She herself seems unhappy in her marriage from what you’ve expressed. Don’t repeat the cycle. Let’s just say that you marry the woman of your mom’s choosing, there is a high chance that your mom would still develop resentment because she does not want to share the perfect man that SHE raised. Plus, you would also not be happy in that situation. 

The best thing to do is her to let her know that you love her because you want to be happy in love. Marrying within the same culture does not ensure happiness (EXHIBIT A: your parents). 

Wishing happiness for you and your partner. I hope your mom can open her heart and accept your partner. I think more than for you, it would be in her benefit to do so.",224,2025-08-11 20:12:09,False,"I (29M, Indian) told my mom that I’m in a relationship with a Chinese woman (27F), and she absolutely lost it.. now I don't know what to do next?",369,2025-08-11 19:31:18,136,,,,,,[]

Of course life is more difficult without the support of family, but it's a hell of a lot easier than life with a family like mine. Or yours.

Her having issues with you dating a Non-Indian woman could have many reasons:

- She wants an Indian daughter-in-law as she expects her to submit to certain cultural rules, e.g. your mother having more power in the family, than your wife

- She doesn't want to ""lose"" you and the emotional support you provide for her

It’s FILLED with this from the Americanized children whose foreign born parents are shocked, SHOCKED that their children didn’t grow up the same way as they did.

Whether it’s the racism, or the lack of conservatism, or whatever it is, it’s always the same basic thing.

The child grows up, the parent expects the sometimes 30 year old to act like it’s still the patriarchal homeland and they’ll be obedient to the elder, that doesn’t happen, cue rage and tears and threats, etc.

Dude, my advice is this:

You’re an adult, you set the terms for a place in your life.

If your parents won’t accept your choices, they don’t accept you, and they’re free to live without you.  Conservative, old school parents from very traditional cultures often have a hard time accepting differences in their children’s worldviews, and you simply can’t negotiate it without giving up your independence.

Also, FWIW, I do have a friend who is the child of South Asian immigrants who were very upset when he came out as gay. It took many years for the relationship to be repaired, but he stayed strong in his self-love and never tried to hide or apologize, and when he got married to his husband a couple years ago, his parents were dancing at his wedding so hard it put shame to us young folks, we couldn't keep up.

I’d shore up your relationships with relatives and family friends. If they aren’t conservative in “dating is bad” way, introduce your girlfriend around, invite people out to dinner, keep attending events even if it is just you. People will see that way that you aren’t being mean to her or changing in a bad way and your mom’s fear of what people will say is turned on its head. Because it truly isn’t her information to control and those friends and family in the community are as much yours as they are hers. I suspect she will come around if only to save face once she sees that others know and aren’t shunning you. 

If you have a friendly auntie who is her peer, see if they’ll talk to her. My mom did that for one of my friends who married a white, Christian woman. His mom expressed how sad and embarrassed she was, and my mom told her that she shouldn’t feel that way. That her future daughter in law was impressive and sweet, but most importantly, she made her son happy. Basically giving her reassurance that the fear of being looked down on was mostly in her own head. Now that worked for my friend because our community genuinely had become more easy going by that point and more people were marrying outside the culture and our religion, so your mileage may vary.

Sometimes time and understanding can change people's mindset and I hope that happens here.  I (white guy) dated an Indian girl in college, and her family became somewhat tolerant of me (over 3.5 years).  We broke up due to distance but I like to think some barriers were lowered over that time.

She’s smart enough to know and understand that you’re an adult that is capable of making their own decisions. She doesn’t want to because you are her possession and you’re not living your life the way she planned for you. 

She may cut you off/disown you but that’s also manipulation and wounded ego. So are you going to be her puppet for the rest of your life or live your own life and disappoint her?

I am in complete agreement about living your own life. BUT as someone who has been part of interracial families I’ll tell you life looks different 10 or 15 or 20 plus years down the road. Children greatly shift the dynamic. Things that didn’t seem important culturally suddenly become very important and that adds to the strain of the relationship. 

I am not saying it can’t be done. What I am trying to emphasize is that cultural differences seem to come into the spotlight when children are involved. Religion, language, holiday celebrations, traditions all of these things that may seem small now or even cute become very different when tiny humans are present. If your children are completely immersed in Chinese culture and favor that would you be okay? And vice versa for your gf? Would she be okay with that? 

Also sometimes people change as they age. They fall into patterns they witnessed growing up and may all of a sudden want to be more closely identified with their culture and in that case if the spouse is not open and willing to embrace both then that causes friction. Think about the cultural differences between you and your parents. You’re all of Indian origin but having been born and raised here there’s already a gap there. I would bet that’s it’s similar for you gf. I mean just by dating one another you’re already participating in American culture. 

So what happens when Indian, Chinese, and American cultures collide and you have to make choices?

ETA: I realize I just went off on a tangent about the cultural differences and challenges. Your mom isn’t entirely wrong about that. BUT also it’s not to say that it’s always a bad thing. I think if you and your gf can have some very honest conversations and maybe even counseling/ coaching on interracial relationships that could be beneficial to establish healthy boundaries and how to approach this with families. As many others suggested shore up family support. Find your tribe and keep them.

n8b29qc,1mnwt92,relationship_advice,l00zrr,"An emotionally mature response is to believe your mom. When she said youre dead to her and you ruined her life, believe her. Whe. She said she won't meet your gf, attend the wedding, or meet your children, believe her. Take her at her word. Yes it's more than likely it's just manipulation on her part to try to control you. But if you don't play the manipulation game she won't have any ammo. 

My mother was similar. I got therapy and learned about boundaries. When my mother told me I was a horrible daughter and a liar, I believed that's how she saw me as and went no contact for several months. When she reached out and asked how we weren't talking I told her I believed her and removed myself from her life so it would be easier for her. Since then (it's been over 5 years) she is careful with her words and we have a polite/cordial relationship. She does lament from time to time that she has to walk on eggshells around me and has to watch what she says (lol) because I take her seriously. 

Will this be your future? No idea. But start taking her at her word. Move out. Apologize for ruining her life. Be honest. Sad she feels this way. Hopefully if she ever stops feeling like you've ruined her life she can reach out. But until then it's unhealthy for her to be in contact with you.

OP this is coercive control and manipulative abuse.

When we are put in the position that our appropriate adult choices harm them and the F.O.G. - Fear, Obligation and Guilt - of displeasing them keeps us from our agency and authenticity THAT IS ABUSE.

Your mother's abuse was not getting help for herself and turning you into her emotional husband, her best friend and her ONLY support she was putting her adult needs on a child, her child.

No one healthy and loving does that.

It's so uncomfortable now bc separation and individuation really sucks for abusers. 

You going out and getting the life YOU CHOOSE was not on her agenda.

OP, THAT IS HER PROBLEM. 

A parent that expects their child to only do what they want is setting everyone up for failure. 

I had to go no contact with my remaining parental figure and with most of my immediate family a few years ago.

I was 55.

I'm sorry you've refused to deal with the unhappiness in your life by *choosing* to rug-sweep your problems and dump your emotional needs on me instead of on a professional therapist who could help you work through them. It makes me sad to see you unhappy, but I won't be marrying to make YOU happy, I'll be marrying to make ME happy. I was not born to be your emotional support pet; your duty is to fix yourself, your problems, your unhappiness on your own with the help of a professional. It's unhealthy to expect ME to make YOU magically happy with my life choices. 

I don't care if people will gossip; it doesn't bother me. I have kept the traditions and beliefs of our family and our culture that are important to me and eliminated the rest. I have no idea why you immigrated to the US if all you want is to live like we're in the old country; we're not! Need I remind you that I'm an American and I live like one. You would feel so much better if you tried finding an Indian therapist who would understand the cultural background of our family and your marriage who could help you find your own happiness or at least acceptance.

I'm sure your family was unhappy about you moving all the way to the US without them, but you needed to be that woman who moved. I need to date/marry the person who makes him happy regardless of how happy/unhappy you will be with the outcome.

Our kids talk about their vacations with a great deal of pleasure. They loved their trips to grandparent's homes. My dad took my son out to ride tractors and feed pigs and check cattle. He was retired by the time my daughter was born so didn't do those things with her. My mom baked bread and cookies with the kids and took them to the garden to pick things like tomatoes. The kids loved it! We took day trips to things like a fossil museum in Hays and the Kansas Cosmosphere in Hutchinson and the Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene and to the Pony Express museum.

We stopped to see things on the way. We've ridden on boats on the Mississippi, seen the arch and wandered its museum, seen the Cahokia Mounds, Lincoln Presidental Library, Hannibal Missouri and the Mark Twain Museum, etc. We've visited caverns and the Smithsonian.

For example, maybe you want to go to Mexico for Christmas. You can travel to your in-laws and then fly to Mexico from the closest airport. Maybe your in-laws want to join you on that Mexican vacation. Once you start planning, you may find that a trip to Mexico is too expensive and whatever you want to do has to be closer and cheaper. This may be part of the reason why your husband wants to vacation close to family (i.e. cheaper and familiar). 

Also, once you start travelling, you get a sense of what your style would be. For example, some people's vacation has to be the same 5 star all inclusive resort or it could be a cheaper and different resorts but lots of day trips. You and your husband need to talk about this from many different angles: money, vacation days, activities, etc. Your husband may be open to travelling once he gets started, and planning a trip (even if you don't take it) may be a good way to start the conversation.",4,2025-08-11 16:01:19,False,"Told my [26F] husband [30M] our vacations can no longer only be at his parent's place now that we have a family, and we're not on the same page",1411,2025-08-11 11:26:03,464,,,,,,[]

n89rhq3,1mnkyso,relationship_advice,lyncati,"As a former child therapist, children tend to develop faster/be more rounded when they have the opportunity to visit several places not like their own culture. It is actually why a version of iq tests were revised because the children from wealthy families who had seen more of the world performed significantly better on the test compared to someone who only goes to the same places / doesn't travel.

Even now, children who travel tend to be more mature and have more emotional intelligence / other life skills when compared to children of the same age who do not travel or only travel to family.

Other people gave great advice and tips, but I figured maybe going at the angle that it is good for a child's development may help your husband see things differently or make him more willing to do things other than visit family.

They can come to you I guess, but it's typical to travel to family for holidays. 

You need to be better at communicating, because my first read-through of this was like, what's wrong with parent's house? Is it a terrible place for a kid? But then I did a second and see you want more variety. 

First of all, your kid won't care where she's at. She's going to cry wherever you take her lol.

But you want to go to different places. That makes more sense. And it's not just your decision like it isn't just his. So, you come to the table with recommendations. ""Let's go to X location this Fall / Spring."" And give a reason why. To try these local foods, to see this local attraction, to visit this specific museum.

When vacation days are very limited, it is common to spend many vacations visiting family in order to make those relationships strong.  You might suggest that his side of the family join you to do or visit things you would like to do on vacations.  

It is likely though, that the desire to have his family know your daughter will make him reluctant to simply make vacations away from family when it is not easy to spend time with them during working weeks.  You may need to think about creative ways to accomplish both.

Yes this is one of the topics you should visit before marriage, but even if you did, it isn’t a particularly meaningful discussion, at least as respects vacation.  It helps you learn how your partner feels about their family.  It doesn’t tell you about how you will be scheduling vacations for the next several years.

Assuming you went into your marriage believing it would last a life time, this is one of the situations that requires you to step back and take a longer view.

Your post makes it sound like for the rest of your lives you will be forced to spend every single vacation with your spouses family.  Stop and think about all the variables that will occur over your life time and even your kids childhood that will affect this.  Family members may get sick. They may leave the family home. Family will die.  Some will move away. You may get transferred to another city, you may have more or less vacation time to schedule each year, your finances may change for the better or worse.  You, your spouse or your kids may develop specific hobbies or interests that dictate where you travel to. All of these things will throw a spanner in long term vacation plans.

If you know of a specific vacation you want to take in the next 12 months, figure out if you can afford it, if you and/or spouse have enough time off from work to go there, start planning it and then talk to your spouse. Lay out your plans for this specific vacation and show your spouse how that still gives you time to spend with his family.

Be specific, about this particular vacation.

But his parents won't live forever and probably enjoy seeing your family. I say this as the half of the couple living away from family. Its no one's fault, but it does feel unfair that one family is so accessible while the other is not. I go home twice a year and my parents visit us once a year.

n862xbq,1mnkyso,relationship_advice,FiberKitty,"I wish you luck. This is an issue worth standing your ground on. The issues may go deeper than vacation location.

I was in your shoes about 30 years ago. 

Husband's parents had moved to a lovely area that we also planned to move to eventually. The argument for visiting them were valid: nice area, low cost vacation, good to connect with family and we didn't know how much time his parents had (my family lived closer to us). When we had kids, we wanted the kids to have a deep connection to that place and the grandparents. What could possibly go wrong?

The reality turned out a bit different. We spent every nearly every one of his vacation days at his parents' place or driving for days to and from. The grandparents would do brief activities with the kids, but the rest of the time it was my job to keep them entertained, fed, and out of their hair while they did grownup things and my husband did chores around their property.

I was frustrated with how little time we got to spend together bonding as a family and how little of his vacation I got to spend with him. There were memorable moments here and there, but they were not the stuff that made for shared stories of our family unit. At least once every trip I would end up grabbing a bit of solo time to go someplace quiet and cry. 

Looking back, I have some regrets. The relationship the kids built with their grandparents could have happened with half the amount of visiting time. There are so many places we didn't get to see through our children's eyes, places that would have been new to us that we could have discovered together. I believe my husband missed out on bonding time with our kids because he always had another focus calling for his attention. His parents lived into their 90s. He always had a hard time saying No to them.

I can now see that the situation arose in the first place because of poor boundary issues within his family and with me not having the perspective or strength to challenge them effectively. If reddit had been around then, I might have been able to find the tools to set limits that benefitted our family without triggering a family rift.

Look at the bigger picture. This will affect how you and your husband plan and communicate in the future.",-1,2025-08-11 13:04:08,False,"Told my [26F] husband [30M] our vacations can no longer only be at his parent's place now that we have a family, and we're not on the same page",1411,2025-08-11 11:26:03,464,,,,,,[]

n8bcg7d,1mnkyso,relationship_advice,TennisLuvr26,"To OP - You, your  husband and child see your family often since they are local. Your husband wants to see his family and have them spend time with your daughter. Totally fair. 

You mention that you want a vacation to other places because your daughter is now toddling around. Trust me when I tell you that most children don’t remember experiences that happen before the age of about 6 or 7 unless they invoke a significant emotional response. They will still enjoy new experiences but they won’t really remember them when they are older. So, I wouldn’t spend a lot of money on vacations with children in the early years. And, it is important for her to spend time with his parents, too. Spending time with his parents was super important to my husband. And it was important to me for my children (especially since my parents died before we had children) even though I wanted to be somewhere else. So, these are the things that we did:

— Hosted his parents and sister during the holidays when the kids were young. We lived too far apart to drive and I didn’t want to fly with a baby or toddler. We used less vacation time, our kids spent time with the grandparents and aunt. If your husband has multiple siblings that live near his parents, then this may not work for you. He may want the entire family experience. If so, then maybe go to his family for one holiday a year or every other year. And have his parents come to you for another holiday or alternate. 

— When visiting his parents, we took our children to all of the local attractions. And they loved going to their favorites every year. We also had date nights and left the kid(s) with the grandparents (everybody wins - free babysitting, free time, grandparents spoiling their grandchildren without any oversight or judgement).

— Extended family vacations. Pick a place, rent a house, everyone contributes financially. Again, free babysitting, date nights, family nights, shared meals. The place can be based on events or activities that you can take advantage of while you are there. We liked to ski and play tennis, so we sometimes went to those places and did those activities while the grandparents watched the young kids.  Once the kids were old enough to participate we signed them up for ski school and other stuff so the grandparents got more of a vacation, too.

— Dropped the kids off at the grandparents or had them come to us and then continued en route to our husband and wife only vacation. When you get comfortable with the idea, trust me THIS IS THE WAY. Everybody wins here. I spent at least a couple of weeks with my dad’s parents every summer and I loved it. My kids spent 2-3 weeks with my husband’s parents for several summers. I video-chatted with them regularly and they made memories. And learned how to adjust to different household rules and personalities. This one may be hard for you to adjust to at first, but once you get used to it is wonderful. When you have kids you are never alone - trust me that having some alone time is like heaven AND  your kids are making memories with their grandparents.

Note that none of this applies if your husband’s parents are truly untrustworthy.",1,2025-08-12 09:40:55,False,"Told my [26F] husband [30M] our vacations can no longer only be at his parent's place now that we have a family, and we're not on the same page",1411,2025-08-11 11:26:03,464,,,,,,[]

I agree.  At no point did I say she should drop it and accept that.  I've advised her to compromise, and accept the small change he's offered, a detour of a few days, and revisit the conversation later.  The child is 1 year old.  They won't form memories for at least 2-3 years on average.

>If they only do one yearly trip it's not unreasonable to visit them once a year but they should start trying to save for extra vacations that are not that same trip.

I agree.  Once the child is 5 or older they should be going to Disney World or something instead of to Grandma and Grandpa's house.  But 1 year old isn't when that should happen.

>In our family we take 2-4 vacations a year and some will be with family (ie meet at a resort or rent a cottage together) and some just our little unit.

Your family sounds like it has lot of money to take vacations that often.  Growing up I got one week of vacation sometimes two a year all at once in the summer.  Granted my Mom and Dad's families both lived within one hour so we'd visit them nearly every week.

>The grandparents also should be flying out to visit though with an infant or even kids. It's so ouch easier to travel without young kids and if they want to see the grandkids they have to put in some work.

That's a ""have plenty of money"" way of thinking.  The average American household has what 66k a year?  That's average, meaning half of people have less than that.

And it definitely doesn’t mean that it didn’t come at a cost at the expense of him and his closeness and that of their children to his family. 

People move for a lot of reasons and moving to be closer to family is not an unreasonable one or even an unusual one. I have no idea where you got that his family wasn’t willing to visit. It doesn’t say that anywhere in the post. It’s possible that the reason they always visit his parents vs the other way around may be because he also has friends or other reasons to want to visit his hometown. 

I am someone who met my husband in my hometown, we got married and had our child in my hometown and because of that, most of our trips have been to visit his family from afar. (Even though him living in my hometown had nothing to do with me, him staying sure did). One of the reasons, we have decided to move closer to his family is because I want my vacations back and it’s a lot easier for my family to visit us (smaller group) than his family to visit us. These are reasonable decisions when there is the will and way to do it (assuming they can afford a move, there is potential for good work options, and it fits several other factors, school districts, home prices, etc).

And even though you’re struggling with it, you’re really trying to maintain closeness and intimacy with your boyfriend, to give your partner what he needs. That’s so hard to do when you’re depressed. 

An out of the box idea that may help with your libido is to try and read or listen to some smut. Books can be a great distraction from the world and are a hell of a lot more healthy than doomscrolling. If your libido came back, it may just solve these feelings of obligation.

n8dsx4x,1moo6ai,relationship_advice,Two-Theories,"SSRIs have known, common, side effects of causing a loss of libido and anorgasmia, and unless your depression is classed as severe, the medication is less helpful than exercise or any other non-medical intervention tested.  Whether your current medication is similar is a matter for you to check but in any event, if you don't find the medication helpful, you don't have to stay on it. Obviously, talk to your doctor as you will need to taper. 

Taking sex off the table for a fixed period of time e.g. a month, two, three (pick a time period) will help, and allow you to focus on, and enjoy, non-sexual touch without feeling the pressure for it to end in sex. 

Use that time to tackle your depression as if it is an emergency. Are you repressing something, or denying some part of yourself? Is there anything you can think of that might give you a sense of purpose or excitement etc? What do you think might help? And then do it and see if that helps.

n8dywyh,1moo6ai,relationship_advice,changerofbits,"The obvious thing to me is that you should worry less about sex and keep working on your depression. Your mental health is way more important than the frequency of him getting his dick wet. Like, let’s say you had high libido and he broke his leg. Would you be upset that he can’t bang you like a screen door in a hurricane and ruin the relationship because of that, or would you be supporting him in recovering from the broken leg and be fine with taking things as slow as he needs while he gets PT and slowly builds back muscle and strength that have atrophied? That’s how he feels, he wants to have an active sex life with you, but he understands that you are suffering and doesn’t want you to have sex you don’t want to have, he just wants you to get better and have sex that you that you want to have with him.

Honestly, I think it’s the depression that is feeding these thoughts, and it’s becoming a negative feedback mechanism for your depression.

Girl you’re doing great. You’re struggling and trying to get better and you’re still very much caring for your bf. Try to take the fact he isn’t pressuring you or bothering you as a good thing & that he understands what you’re going through. 

Keep an open line of communication about it with him. He deserves to know how you feel. Maybe he likes when you please him once a week and doesn’t mind waiting for more. Men can be capable of pleasing themselves as well. It’s complicated and up to you both what you are comfortable with. 

100% talk about it in therapy and maybe he would like his own therapy too and you can encourage him with that. It’s important to see a therapist during transition periods of life especially if it’s stressful or confusing. 

I know for a fact when I was on Zoloft I lost all feeling down there and had absolutely 0 desire for sex even if it was just to please my partner and not myself. It was NO fun AT ALL. Only thing that helped was getting off of it but not everyone is able to do that and another medication can very well cause issues as well.

n8e0xcs,1moo6ai,relationship_advice,mister_burns1,"Probably not the answer you’re looking for, but I think this plan would actually work:

If you get pregnant and have a child (with him), then you’ll probably get a long grace period of not feeling as much pressure to have sex, both from him and from yourself.

Then once the baby arrives, men are more likely to expect and accept less sex, because they know having a baby is hard work and you will be tired.

Once pressure ramps up because baby is bigger, you can get pregnant again and reset the cycle. This should buy you 5-6 years.

After 2 kids, he’ll be much more ‘locked in’, so you can have a lot less sex and his likelihood of leaving will be lower. And you’ll still have 2 young kids that make sex difficult. Although expectations for sex will eventually ramp back up, it will probably be to a lower level.

There are tons of guys out there who say their partner wants to have weekly sex sometimes even 2-3 times a week but the guys have no desire. They’d be fine with once a month.

She honestly said she doesn't share those feelings without being cruel so yay on that too. My advice is to find another girl who intrigues you and date her sincerely.  After you have been with her a while the relationship will either flourish or wither over time.

  
If eventually you two go your separate ways & you're still in touch with HS girl maybe you two can comisserate a little. Maybe she has had one or two relationships & now sees the world,and possibly you,differently.

  
Don't have expectations but do keep in contact. Be the best you you can. Perhaps she will reconsider your past feelings as not misdirected. Or maybe she'll get married & you'll be a groomsman.

  
Because this is the nature of being a man. We get shot down all the time. But there is no crying in baseball so we suck it up and try again.

n8eob0p,1motbk4,relationship_advice,AltMiddleAgedDad,"We met during freshman orientation at age 18 and started dating immediately. We engaged at age 20 and married at 22, a week after we graduated college.

We had nothing but her car, some student loans, and our clothes when we got married.  We built our entire life together.

We decided to move to the region I had a job lined up after graduation because she was a teacher and you can get teaching jobs anywhere in the country. We didn’t decide what specific suburb to move to until she received her job offer.

So, that meant we didn’t have a place to live when we returned from our honeymoon and lived in my father in law’s basement. When we got back, she finished interviewing for jobs, accepted an offer, and we signed our first lease.

25 years later and we have built an amazing life together. I am the luckiest man in the world that she wanted to marry me and keeps picking me!

Advice I would have is that if you get engaged and get married, keep communicating, keeping dreaming, keep planning, agree upon short and long-term goals, and be willing to compromise. You are building a life together so not everything you individually planned will align perfectly. There will be give and take. Keep the focus on the life you want to build together and not individual goals.

But if you aren’t engaged to marry, then don’t give him husband privileges by planning your life around him. If he won’t commit to marry, then you must plan for your own best interests.",3,2025-08-12 20:22:11,False,"Couples that met in college, how did you build a life after graduation?

n8ert01,1motbk4,relationship_advice,Serenyx,"That's definitely a tricky question that I have seen many of my friends ask themselves! Ultimately, it's up to you, there are many different answers possible. I have friends who have lived for a few years in different cities, taking advantage of remote working to spend more time with each other until they were able to land a job in the same town. Others who have decided to go their own way, and that's ok too. For me:

I met my boyfriend at the beginning of our 3rd out of 5 years of college. When things became serious we started talking a lot about how we see the future, the kind of life we wanted, and where. So we could see early on that our long-term plans aligned well.

We started looking for work in our targeted area on the basis of whoever finds work first, the other follows. But that's when covid happened and changed our plans a little bit. I decided to pursue longer studies in another city, and my boyfriend followed me there (he did not want us to be apart and most of the job offers available at the time gravitated around this city). Once I graduated, I targeted a job in a specific field but also in the specific area we wanted to build a life in. We moved there, and have just bought our house! 

So lots of communication is important, as for everything so there is no resentment building up.

the main idea right now is that we have been making big decisions for ourselves without eachother in mind because it's a huge part of our lives and early on in our relationship: my loan contract, his education out of state. We're figuring out how to start making big life decisions as a unit and merge two entire lives, which is such a crazy idea.

That you feel so strongly that he is enough for you that you won't accept it anymore. That you both are going to fight against it, and self reflect on where it may come from. Look EVERYONE is insecure about something. And most men struggle with insecurity, sometimes around sex. But not always. Out society just PREACHES that you should quit on your partner over the slightest way they can't measure up. I mean look at the women in this post, they confirm what I'm saying. He probably feels like one day you'll just leave. And you don't want to have to be responsible for someone's insecurities. You can however plan to attack the problem together. And alot more work gets done when it's a team effort.",4,2025-08-12 07:17:56,False,How do I reassure my bf (23M) that he does sexually please me (25F)?,133,2025-08-11 22:45:17,59,,,,,,[]

But you know it is more than that. You know he needs therapy, you know that you two will have to work a heap just to get a baseline healthy dynamic.

Because it really seems like you can't win. It feels like no matter what course of action you take he will find an excuse to take a swing at you. You just know that eventually when you compliment him enough he'll pivot and say you do it too much and don't mean it. You know if you don't have enough sex he feels rejected, you know when you try and be aggressive he pulls the 'feels used' card. You know that he will take advantage of you, force you to buy a round and act weird and jealous and controlling when people are nice to you.

Your boyfriend sounds like my ex - who I now suspect has a cluster B on personality disorder - likely a mix of BPD/NPD. 

The situation was the same for me in the sense that even in the early days - things were difficult with him. I stayed 3 years with this guy and ended it whilst engaged to him. The emotional manipulation gets worse. 

You mentioned being talked at - my ex enjoyed talking AT me too and always mad everything about him and his feelings and his emotions and his displeasure of seemingly mundane things I did. 
I too made lots of excuses for him - and then he just amped it up, and began blaming me for our relationship problems. You’re right, he likely does need therapy - but that’s not your job!

I tried to end it at the 6th mark point and wish I carried through with it - my ex ended up becoming extremely verbally and emotionally abusive. 

This relationship does not sound good at all - and these are the beginning stages. You’ve already said you’ve not faced these issues anywhere else.

To bring up examples of how he has shown you that he loved you in the past is just trying to divert attention from the undeniable fact that he told another girl that you weren't his girlfriend. There is only one reason to do that. Especially if she has you blocked! 

Now an extra bit you didn't ask for. You are so young and I'm sure you are mature and have every right to date anyone you want. I just want to say it's pretty uncommon that a 28 year old guy with good intentions is interested in someone so much younger for the right reasons. These guys usually say things like ""You're so mature for your age"" in the courting phase, then turn to ""You just don't have the same life experience"" or ""You're too young to understand"" when it benefits them. The cold shoulder after you ignored him because he did something obviously wrong is a clear manipulation tactic. So is throwing in all of the ways he has shown that he loved you... By bringing you to a graduation party? And leaving when you were tired? He wants a cookie for the bare minimum.

It's only one situation, but if this feels like it applies to more than just this situation, no point in wasting your time with him! All in all, if he respected you or your relationship, he wouldn't have told her that you weren't just a friend.

The first step... Show me your phone.

If you had a trusting and stable relationship, that not have happened in the first place.

But, something smelt off to you. So, you needed to check it out.

And... Your suspicions proved accurate. He told another woman you were just a friend, not a good look. Found actual dirt.

Except... Its only a fight. You're pissed off for good reason. Went looking for dirt... Found it.

But.

Going to stick around for him. Not walking away from him.

You didn't trust him from the start. Now you have good reason not to trust him even more. And continuing this hot mess will end with you spinning with justified trust issues, a never ending cycle. 

However... You rather fight with him for the hell of it instead of walking away from it so you can find better.

At what point do you choose to walk away?

The steps should go:

1. Suspicious weak trust.
2. Phone check.
3. Confirmed reason not to trust.
4. Breaking up.

Due to some similar circumstances when we first met, I was always mildly suspicious that she had really wanted another guy but had ""settled"" for me when he wasn't as into her. She promised me that was not the case at all. 

And I loved her, she was beautiful and she said she wanted the same things as me, she's funny, she didn't think I was a big nerd, you know, all the important stuff. We were together for 32 years. We have two daughters who I would not trade for anything but after all that time, she decided her perfect guy was this coworker of hers instead of me. I really thought we had passed the point of that ever happening, I thought I had being a good husband pretty well figured out. But I think she felt about him like I always felt about her. So all those times she assured me she felt the same, she really didn't. But NOW she understood what I meant.

n8es1xj,1motgtn,relationship_advice,Low_Temperature9593,"You can't expect to be treated like a spouse until you are one. Sounds like you're not even engaged yet, so bringing up your marital expectations in this context comes off as manipulative. Perhaps you can ask to be top priority once you are her spouse, but it isn't reasonable to expect her to prioritize her boyfriend over her sister.

That said, I'm not seeing a massive difference in values here - you both clearly value family, she doesn't disagree with you about there being a measure of self-sacrifice in a marriage. 

The biggest difference I'm seeing is that you don't acknowledge the importance of individual needs and commitments - but I wonder if that's always the case for you? And how do you decide which one of you is doing the self-sacrificing for the other? 

You're asking her to choose between being present for you, or being present for her sister. You might feel like your grandmother's death is more significant than her sister's birthday, because it is more significant for you and your family. 

For her and her sister, this birthday is of particular significance and, while her sister will have more birthdays (hopefully!) this one is unique as the first they'll be able to celebrate together - it sounds like there's some trauma and grief in that story. 

Given the backstory, I'm sure it would cause her sister a significant amount of grief to be cancelled on, and would quite possibly cause a rift in their relationship. If she's the only mother figure her sister has known, and she's been unable to celebrate with her before, I'm gathering that the two of them are low or no contact with their parents. Are your girlfriend and her sister in touch with their other family members, or are the two of them on their own family-wise?",7,2025-08-12 20:48:53,False,I’m worried my (27 M) and my girlfriend’s (23 F) values might differ too much.

n8f5hv4,1motgtn,relationship_advice,Low_Temperature9593,"I see, that reason does give her choice a different flavor than how it sounded in your post. 

I can sympathize with both of your positions, I don't lean too far in one direction over the other. I'm trying to remember how long it took me to develop the same expectations as you have in my first long-term relationship, with the man I married - really it wasn't until we got our own place together, which was only shortly before we got married. 

When you move in together, it feels like the natural progression for your lives to become more and more synced up, and you feel increasingly invested in each other's lives. Going from two individuals to one couple, as you put it, feels healthier when it's not forced. Ideally, there's minimal pressure or disagreement happening around your role and level of involvement with your partner's social sphere and whatever other things they bring to the relationship. 

I've been in a handful of long-term relationships at this point in my life and the level of cohesion between my life and the lives of my partners has varied dramatically, from *we did literally EVERYTHING together, even worked together* to *we've never held a conversation with one another's family members* - each time it was unique to the relationship and the best results came from whatever developed organically, as opposed to when it was based on pressure - which tends to breed resentment. 

The purpose of dating is to find out if you're compatible, see what sort of relationship develops between you before you decide to make that life-long commitment. While some compromise is necessary in any relationship, you shouldn't need the other person to completely transform into the partner you desire - you should date until you find someone you're compatible with, who wants basically the same type of relationship and life. It should feel natural and authentic. 

If you decide to continue the relationship, definitely spend a good amount of time living together before marriage, see what develops. You each have valid reasons for wanting different things, it's natural to feel disappointed for not having what you want in this instance but it doesn't have to be a point of contention. When you return from seeing your grandmother, use this disagreement as an opportunity to learn more about your partner, have some deep conversations about what you each envision for the future, what your timelines are, what kind of marriage and family life you hope to have.",1,2025-08-12 22:36:50,False,I’m worried my (27 M) and my girlfriend’s (23 F) values might differ too much.

n8fdrbg,1motgtn,relationship_advice,Two-Theories,"The emotional impact or grief of an elderly relative passing is usually a lot less than when it is unexpected/sudden and/or relates to someone as close as immediate family. You had mentioned attending with some family, but if even if it is just your mom, you two can grieve together albeit you ought to be mindful that she has suffered the greater loss (i.e. a parent) and, if you can, offer support to her and/or prioritise her needs/comfort. Also consider that your mom might prefer for your gf not to be present because e.g.  she might consider it to be a family/private matter, your gf doesn't know your grandmother that well, your mom may not feel comfortable grieving in front of your gf, your mom may want to spend time (or grieve) with you one-on-one, etc.",1,2025-08-12 23:53:52,False,I’m worried my (27 M) and my girlfriend’s (23 F) values might differ too much.

Honesty, without tact, is cruelty. Don’t make shitty jokes in the name of breaking tension. Don’t say cruel things because they happen to be true.

The number one piece of advice I can give to is you as a guy is that, if a woman tells you that something you’re doing is hurting her, then it is your problem *whether you agree that her feelings should be hurt or not.* Full stop. Bc, again, she’s dealing with the consequences of it, and they are painful af.

On top of that, forgetting damn near everything that your gf tells you is hurtful and unfair, bc you are going to end up in situations like this. Is it your fault that your memory is poor? No, but it is your problem, and you need to make it *your problem* instead of just your girlfriend’s. 

Find solutions. How do you remember stuff at work or at school? You write things down. You make note of what is important. You study that shit, revisit it, and find ways to retain what you need to. It can be trauma related, so get your ass to counseling. (Would help with the ED thing as well, esp bc it sounds like there might be some body/food stuff going on for you as well.) Could be ADHD related, in which case you should get treated for that.

n8e7bly,1moqmil,relationship_advice,Fam_RH,"Let's go through each of the situations. Yes, you blocking him without any warning was a bit off and definitely not the best approach to it, but as you said, you were looking out for you, and something inside you went directly to block him.

Yes, it is a bit of projection on your part to compare one addiction to another, because it's a different situation and different people. Buuuuut the keyword is to actually realize that they are both addictive, not because weed itself causes addiction, but, as he said, it ""frees"" him and makes him happy. That mindset sounds a lot like an addict, he can justify his consumption and normalize it because his family does it as well. It's inevitable that he'll keep that going. If you grow up in a family that normalize alcoholism, you won't see the problem either.

As for the effort in the relationship, it sounds like a sofa boyfriend, he is there physically but doesn't do much, you can carry him to wherever and he'll be like a sofa, just there. I'm not saying it's necessarily the case, but sounds like it.
Now for the birthday gift, I don't think it's childish to expect it. For some people their birthday are really important, for other people gifts are really important, for some both, for some none. It's ok to want something, even if it's a small gesture, buut you have to be clear about this type of things, because he might've not realized that it was a big deal for you. Yes, for some may look like a basic thing to do, but it's not the same for everyone. 

Finally I'm against telling what you should, but I would ask, if he never stops the weed consumption would you stay with him? Even in the best scenario, he slows down the consumption but still does it every 2 days, would you stay? You would need to imagine the best possible scenario that you can think of, knowing him and see if you would stay.",1,2025-08-12 18:33:41,False,I (25f) need some advice with me and my bf’s (24m) weed addiction and relationship,2,2025-08-12 18:01:33,8,,,,,,[]

n8emlgw,1moqmil,relationship_advice,Akasha250,"Your knee jerk reaction actually was a pretty sane thing and yes, it was self protection. Being egoistic isn't always a bad thing. Sometimes, it's very advisable. Giving chances to people who will not take said chance with 99% probability is a waste of your life time and gives you a free heartache. 

The battle you're not wanting to go though, that's one you'd lose anyway. Addicts don't get sober when someone tells them to do so. They do when they hit rock bottom. You know from experience that rock bottom can be VERY deep. It's no different with weed.

Addiction is addiction. The effect of the drug is different, but there's a whole lot of things that will be the same because they're part of addiction, not of alcoholism specifically. The lies. The fights. The disappointments. The bad feeling on your way home. Them being not sober enough to do something they're supposed to do. Problems at work. This feeling of being second place to the drug. The check for whether he's kind of sober when you meet. Worrying about being sober enough to drive. So yeah, very much compare him to your father. They have the same illness and there definitely will be similarities in both their behaviour and your emotional reaction to it. ​

Weed actually has a pretty big influence on the personality, it just doesn't make people loud like alcohol often does. It makes them passive. It's possible that this date planning thing is part of the addiction problem, too. Also, since you've rarely seen him sober, you probably don't really know him. ​",1,2025-08-12 20:10:29,False,I (25f) need some advice with me and my bf’s (24m) weed addiction and relationship,2,2025-08-12 18:01:33,8,,,,,,[]

n894ted,1mnxxtc,relationship_advice,SafferEvs,"Yes, you're being manipulated and coerced into having sex. You're also being emotionally manipulated in general. I'm sure it feels like an impossible task to leave him, but I can't see how you can possibly stay and be happy. You've spent years communicating with him about what you need and how his behaviour is damaging to you, you've gone to couples counseling on two separate occasions to try and improve the relationship and he's put in absolutely zero effort to change and maintain those changes in his behaviour and attitude. He's selfish, unreasonable and manipulative, and has clearly expected you to not only carry the emotional and physical weight of your marriage alone but also the financial, household and parenting responsibilities.

He's not interested in being a good husband or partner and, although you haven't mentioned it in your post, I expect he's shown that he's not interested in being a good parent either? Don't stay for the kids - he won't contribute anything positive to their lives or wellbeing and growing up with adults modelling this kind of behaviour will either be very damaging to them or will influence their own attitudes towards people in unhealthy ways. Don't stay for yourself - he gives you nothing and contributes nothing positive to your life or happiness. Honestly it seems like the only thing he does is contribute negatively to your life.

Definitely get individual therapy for yourself, it'll give you a support system and help you find ways to set boundaries, recognise unhealthy behaviours and respect and love yourself more, but your first move should be to speak to a divorce attorney. You don't need to act immediately, and finding out what your legal options are and what steps you'd need to take regarding your assets, kids, custody and future finances is the smart, safe path.

Now his behavior is certainly not helping but I’m willing to wager that even if he checked all those boxes it would not get you to engage him in more frequent, and enthusiastic encounters.

But you are lying by keeping this from your wife. The fact that Amy has come to rely so heavily on you and your wife is a problem. 

You need to stop giving her the benefit of the doubt - you owe your wife a lot more than you owe Amy and not giving your wife the whole story is *not* protecting her or your marriage. Amy didn’t reach out to apologize all weekend? She didn’t express any regret or shame? Yeah. She’s not a good friend to your wife and calling it a “lapse in judgment” is far too kind. You and your wife are a major support to her and this is how she repays her best friend? 

At best, lines are getting blurred and she’s seeing you as some kind of hero and tying up too many emotions with the favors you do for her. But even if that’s the case, there’s no excuse for acting on it.

If she hasn’t reached out to you, I think she’s trying to see *your* reaction. If you don’t tell your wife, she will take it as a green light to keep pursuing you - especially if you didn’t even reach out to tell her it was inappropriate either.

n87gr1n,1mni5k4,relationship_advice,AStirlingMacDonald,"This wasn’t cheating, but: the thing that makes cheating so despicable is that it’s a betrayal. Betraying someone who loves and trusts you is a shitty, selfish, awful thing to do. 

Amy’s kiss was a betrayal. From what you’ve said, probably a minor betrayal. A lapse in judgement from a person who is currently going through a difficult time, processing trauma, and just generally “not at her best” right now. Fine. 

I understand that you were coming from a place of “not wanting to hurt your wife/cause her to lose a friendship,” but whatever the motives were that you had to not tell her, your wife has the *right* to know about Amy’s betrayal. Every day that you both don’t tell her, you are both compounding that initial, likely minor betrayal, making it a little bit bigger every passing day. Again, the issue isn’t “whether or not you had noble motivations” for not telling her. The issue is that she has the *right* to be told, and as the only one who know about it, you and Amy have the *responsibility* to tell her. 

Tell her, right away. Tell her why you waited so long to tell her. Answer any and every question she has, thoroughly, holding *nothing* back. Apologize. Tell her you are sorry, you were wrong to wait so long. If she is angry with you, understand and accept that her anger is legitimate and valid. Betrayal hurts, terribly. Even little “minor” betrayal.

n8715xk,1mni5k4,relationship_advice,kandixchaotic2,"I understand wanting to protect a strong friendship between this friend & your wife. I also empathize with the fact that up until this incident, you’ve all been very comfortable with this dynamic & changing something you all feel good about can be scary. But you know what’s scarier? Losing trust between you & your wife, or worst case scenario losing her completely over this friend.

It doesn’t matter if it’s the truth or not (it’s probably not) but as people have said on this thread it comes off like you care more about protecting this friend than your wife. Your wife will probably think that too, shit I would think that too if I was your wife.

So my advice:

Tell her like NOW. Explain what you explained to Reddit. Say something along the lines of “look I know I fucked up not saying something right away but your friend kissed me, & this is what lead to it.- It was a lot to digest so I took a few days to fully process what happened. I was scared to ruin your friendship & our current dynamic but in this time I took to think - I realized I should have told you as soon as it happened….. because losing you & our trust & bond is way worse. I am so sorry. I was thinking too much, & what I should have done was include you in those thoughts right from the start.”

Then if possible before she responds, already have a plan with suggested boundaries set. Assure her that she has full autonomy in the situation. Whatever she wants to do, you’re okay with. Take accountability that you handled it poorly yourself from the beginning.

“Honey I know this is hard, but I will be okay with whatever you need. You never want us to be alone again? That’s okay! You want to go full no contact ever again? No problem! Do you want to confront her directly one on one, or do you think it’s best all 3 of us sit down & talk about what happened….. then make a decision from there?”

I imagine because you both are married, you both know each other very well. If you are a good guy who has never given her a reason not to trust you…. You MAY luck out & she may empathize with why you didn’t tell her right away - But even if she is understanding, still expect her to be angry & or disappointed in you. & be ready to accept it. 

Prepare to be fully supportive of whatever she decides, take full accountability for not saying something right away, don’t you dare make an excuse or justification, DO NOT even think about defending this friend by claiming “lapse of judgement”, do not dare utter a word to this friend again via text or any other means until you & your wife agree on a plan TOGETHER, & give your wife FULL control over what happens next. She will be the next person to talk to this friend, NOT you - & going forward you are just along for the ride in fully giving your wife whatever in the world she asks for, & doing whatever she tells you to do in this situation.

I empathize with why you made the choices you made, but that doesn’t mean it was the right choice. You gave up any autonomy or say in the situation, when you made the choice to not tell her from the very start. This needs to be fully in her hands now - & whatever happens, you will need to fully accept it & rally around whatever your wife needs going forward in my opinion.

Good luck. Please update!",3,2025-08-11 16:02:24,False,My Wife(28f)’s best friend(24f) decided to kiss me(26m),759,2025-08-11 09:45:05,481,,,,,,[]

n8a8eeu,1mni5k4,relationship_advice,Snoo_53830,"I have a hard time believing OP. Sounds like he liked the kiss. Maybe he even initiated. Otherwise why not tell your wife the same night? Makes no sense to me. In no world can I imagine not telling my wife this and telling Reddit first. Sounds like insurance just in case if you ask me. 

Outside of that. Why is he so invested in this woman? I mean babysitting so she can work is one thing. But she’s been on plenty dates while he babysits. He’s caught up into her love life. There’s no way I’d know this many details about my wife’s best friend love life nor would I care to know. And I certainly wouldn’t be playing dad while she’s out getting her back blown out.

On top of that, I don’t believe the best friend all that much either. So she’s lying to men about having a child because it’s a touchy subject? How is that touchy? She’s a mother, there’s nothing touchy about it. Then blaming the men for not wanting to date you after clearly being lied to. Lady it’s not that you have a kid, it’s that you didn’t disclose that transparently and give the men the option to consider that fact before buying you dinner. She’s a liar if you ask me.

That leads me to believe she lies about a whole lot more. I’m not going to say rather or not her ex was truly abusive or not, but I’m confused. It sounds like she wants her ex to watch the kid but he doesn’t want to but why does she even want her ex to watch the kid if he’s abusive? And how is it they are still having custody battles in court when he doesn’t even want to watch his kid? It’s possible, I’m just a little hesitant to believe every detail here. I mean ongoing legal battles for almost 3 years when the ex isn’t even wanting custody just makes no sense. It would make more sense for this legal custody battle to be long if Amy is lying and the ex actually wants to be there for his child and is fighting her for rights but she’s just painting the narrative to make her ex the bad guy. I’ve seen this happen in real life so it makes much more sense.

n8ae4p5,1mni5k4,relationship_advice,themuffinman2038,I find it very concerning that a guy that has built enough time with a woman to marry her needs advice from strangers on how to navigate a situation like this. Like telling her the truth is the only logical thing. If she believes that you initiated the whole thing or if the friend throws you under the bus I guess better you find out now that your relationship isn't build on as much trust as you thought.,1,2025-08-12 06:47:34,False,My Wife(28f)’s best friend(24f) decided to kiss me(26m),759,2025-08-11 09:45:05,481,,,,,,[]
n8aefgi,1mni5k4,relationship_advice,Ok-Particular-5865,"First of all, to give you advice- we need to know what kind of kiss this was?  I presume: on your lips? 

If not it is nothing. If so, then quick peck? Firm but short? Just a sign of affection? Or deep?  

You were hugging her- she hugged back? Did she grab you tighter while kissing you? 

And you? Did you return it? Push back ? Deep kiss or just received her kiss? In other words were you participating ? 

So the answer is, it all depends on the details, and this is the detail your wife wants to know. 

Ideally you received it- like a surprise- you didn’t want to extend it- you were passive. Then , you simply say to your wife, I’m realizing Amy is very vulnerable - it would be great if she could find a committed guy who would be good for her and her child - she cried about being stood up the other night- when she cried, I patted her on the head and then I thought well that’s not very sensitive of me so I gave her a hug and that was probably a mistake in that circumstance because I was hugged her and she looked up and kissed me.

Here’s where you’ve gotta be very specific with your wife as to what you did, because if you waffle on this, she’s gonna be suspicious. 

She’s gonna say how long did you hug her?  So you may want to include how long you hugged her so she doesn’t have to ask those kind of questions.

She’s gonna be judging whether this was something that you welcomed or not that’s the key! So you’re gonna wanna make clear whoa I’m not interested in that so I backed off and then I realized I probably shouldn’t have hugged her in that circumstance. There was too much you know she was too emotional.

So you’re gonna say I was shocked I was shocked and I know whatever you did did you back up? Did you release the hug? Did you step back?

Tell her what you did with two things in mind you didn’t want to embarrass Amy and make her think that this was you know that you were rejecting her as a person when you were just trying to comfort her.  At the same time, whatever you did made it clear to her that at least you think it made it clear to her that no this is not appropriate in our relationship as supporter and friend.


 If you engaged in active participation that’s a lapse in judgment on your part- then you need to clearly think through why you did that and that you realize you know that you’ve gotten too close and trying to help her and maybe you need to step back a little bit, but you never expected that because you don’t think of Amy in that way, so very important that you tell your wife that you don’t think of Amy in that way.  And then say you know at first I thought well she was just showing her gratitude for all that we’ve done. She was emotional and she reacted emotionally to my hug instead of thinking of me as a friend.  

So I am thinking about it and I thought well I really need to tell you exactly what happened because it was awkward and you know I want to be supportive of her, but I also want to be careful that it doesn’t cross a line and I feel like she kind of crossed the line there so I’m hoping that she doesn’t look at me in that way, but that was just a lapse- but now I want to be aware of that and be very careful going forward",1,2025-08-12 06:49:12,False,My Wife(28f)’s best friend(24f) decided to kiss me(26m),759,2025-08-11 09:45:05,481,,,,,,[]

She should know better. Especially when you guys are such an essential part of her life. I like what other commenters are saying that you shouldn't be alone with her anymore. I personally as the wife wouldn't allow the arrangement to continue at all because if she's not going to respect me and my marriage, then I'm going to be unwilling to help her out.

You’ve Got to be the first to tell your wife before Amy says anything. 

I’m a woman and what Amy was doing is called the “Compliant Test”. She wanted to see your reaction and to see if she has a chance to go further when you two are alone. 

You’ve showed her that you’re a good stable husband and great dad material. Your wife has done all the work to show Amy (her supposed “friend”) that you’d make a great mate. 

I lived through this experience unfortunately, that what Amy is, is a “Mate Poacher”. 

Do not Ever be alone with her, you guys have to cut her out of your life RTFN!!!

It’s her life, she made it and it’s kind of you and your wife to do so much for her But it’s her problem. 

She see’s You as a way out of her predicament and wants to slide right into your wife’s role and shoes. 

She doesn’t give a shit about your wife or their friendship, or she would have never made the move to kiss you in private. That’s why she crossed the Rubicon by kissing you to see if you’d take the bait and give her the “Go” signal. 

Having you will make her life so much easier. 

I won’t be surprised if when you’re alone with her again, she’ll try something more bold. 

You must get rid of her RTF Now if you want to keep your marriage because girls like this, if they think they have a chance, Will do something to blow your marriage up. 

It’ll be do swift, you won’t even know what hit you.

Do not wait until your wife's friends guilt is the reason this comes out unexpectedly, it'll be even worse if she feels blindsided. You can express to your wife exactly as the situation occurred and explain that you do feel like it was a moment of weakness on her friends part however validate any and all feelings your wife has as valid because she needs to be able to process this information on her own her own way as well if there's any chance of forgiveness for the friendship. Where the kid is concerned there needs to be some set boundaries as others have mentioned the fact that you and your wife are taking on such parental roles seem to really be blurring the lines with someone who's already vulnerable mentally.

On many levels, I personally don’t think a mistake made in a moment of weakness defines a person—especially if you stopped when it could have gotten worse. You seem like a good man who wouldn’t get more deeply involved and make the situation worse.

My wife and I are split on who’s at fault here. I don’t think your wife, if you told her, should blame you for what happened since everyone was acting within what had been established. But my wife believes that taking on the responsibilities you had—and doing them without your wife present—is what set the stage for that moment.

I honestly don’t know if telling her is the right thing to do, for the reasons I’ve mentioned. We all deserve second chances, especially someone with as many emotional struggles as Amy, but I understand where most people are coming from.

You need to tell your wife asap before Amy potentially creates a novella. Tell her exactly how you told us here. She will love you and respect you more than ever. 

You can't control how she'll react. She may have to get fresh air, let her be and she will come back to talk. If you need fresh air, go outside and allow yourself to breathe.  


See, I'm a wife. I never let another woman be alone with my spouse. Idc if it's a female hairstylist or a female cousin. Not happening. My husband is the same way with me. We both observe how they act towards us. 

There are some vile ones out here! (Some men, too). 

When other women/men see a good man/woman already married, established, etc and their situation is not reflecting that, they'll pull a b.s. Stunt like that.

clearly. I'm not trying to change how you view life with a reddit comment, I'm pointing out that you're creating a face to the world that HEAVILY incentivizes people lying to you. And \*most\* people when making decisions will pursue their incentives.

people fail that test daily and they always will. Including you and I. Should we be obliterated for being human? I don't think so. Proportionality matters. Love isn't only loving people when they're awesome.

My first thought would be ""why are they scared of me?"" I've been in a relationship for a long, long time so if my partner was too scared to admit that they'd fucked up, in a pretty minor way, I'd wonder what I'd done to lose their trust.

kissed my husband, in MY driveway while I was IN the house, and he didn’t say shit till days later, here are my thoughts:

1) why didn’t he look uncomfortable when he came back in
2) why don’t I know when my husband is keeping major secretes — how can he hide something like this so well
3) people say he’s like a dad to her kid, what am I not seeing
4) why couldn’t he just talk to me if nothing was really going on

Now the issue isn’t the friends being inappropriate, it’s my imagination going into overdrive. In my relationship it’s all about levels of disrespect. Not specific actions or words, just what constitutes as disrespect. My husband not telling me this would be hella disrespectful. I now know he can be withhold critical information and go about his day without a blink while I sit there oblivious. He went from being a victim and doing absolutely nothing wrong after the forced kiss, to being the villain who played with our trust and bond and for what? To protect her? Because I’m not a good partner and he can’t share with me? Now we gotta go to marriage counseling because he refused to be honest. 

This woman violated her friend’s husband and her home, while her husband just sits there with his thumb up his ass. Hopefully his wife has a higher level of maturity than I.

most people can. Relationships are risky. You never really know what's going on in another human beings mind, whether that be your spouse, your child or your best friend. That's just life.

No, my sister has never been diagnosed with any mental health disorders that I know of. I know she was in therapy during hs which I believe had to do with low self esteem.

I believe that I do generally say no and stick to whatever it is that I said. However, my mother is conflict adverse and always advocates for ""family over everything"". For example with the oatmeal, I said what I said and mentioned that both mother and I would still be expecting something for breakfast tomorrow, even if she needs to drive to the store to buy oatmeal (2mins away). I would have left it at that and followed up to make sure it happened (I pay phone and internet so I can disable at any time), but my mother said ""OP was in the wrong because he didn't remind you. It doesn't hurt to help family."" 

She often says things like that which I think makes it easy for sister to continue how she's been living.

n8evcy4,1moudz3,relationship_advice,Thumatingra,"How likely is it that he was able to get a vasectomy? Most doctors will not perform one for someone his age without children. Could this perhaps be the result not of elective surgery, but of a traumatic injury?


I'm not saying he shouldn't have disclosed that, too, but I think it's understandably hard for people to talk about their traumas, especially if they're very sensitive and if they're afraid it will lead to rejection.


So, before you confront him, question for you: if it is the case that he can't have kids, but it's because of some horrible accident, would you stay with him, and adopt/try for semen extraction? Or leave?


If you think you'd stay, maybe try approaching him in a relaxed way. Say, ""Hey, I can't help but notice that I haven't been in birth control for... and I noticed your scar... and I felt... Did something happen? I want to be here for you, you can tell me.""


If he denies it, you can follow up with, ""Okay then, maybe we should do that visit to the fertility clinic...""


If you don't plan to stay with him unless he's fertile, don't make him potentially go through trauma twice. Just let him go without confrontation. He should get to be with someone who will love him unconditionally, and you should get to be a mom in the way that means the most to you.",2,2025-08-12 21:13:33,False,I [28F] suspect my BF [30M] is hiding his vasectomy,1,2025-08-12 21:02:34,9,,,,,,[]

n8c0x2z,1mogb9a,relationship_advice,Fickle-Cabinet3956,"In your current arrangement 40%/12% split he is actually paying 60% of the overall and rent/bills.  While it doesn't  seem like financial abuse it absolutely is because of the **bait and switch**.  

He led you to believe that you'd pay bills according to income but it sounds like you're splitting the rent/bills 40% (you)/60% (him) and the split on your incomes is 40%/12%.

If you cannot afford basic hygiene items it's clear you need to go back to your former living situation.

I think a fair compromise moving forward is for you to pay between 20%-30% of your income.

20% because that's proportionate to your incomes since you said he makes 5x you:  If you're paying 20% of your income, he's paying 16% of his (he'd be paying 80% of the overall rent/bills).

30% because that's an affordable/reasonable about of someone income to put towards rent/bills.  If you're paying 30% of your income, he's paying 14% of his (he'd be paying 70% of rent/bills).

If he doesn't agree to something between 20%-30% of your income (and 16%-14% of his) towards rent/bills I think you should to be let out of the lease and go back to your previous living arrangement.

What would your plan be if you weren’t with him? How would you pay rent

If skip the dates and ask him to put the money towards rent instead.

If you’re still struggling, I’d tell him you cannot afford the apartment and if things are 50/50 then you have to choose an apartment in your budget where you can afford it 50/50.

I was being vague about actual finances, but the %’s mostly match up to a good work month for me, and a base salary month for him. In reality, he’s making a few thousands more this month than he did at the beginning of the year when we signed the lease.

n8c5dup,1mogb9a,relationship_advice,Piilootus,"I can understand that, but before you do I'd just suggest you look up why leaving an abusive relationship is the most dangerous time to be in one. 

I'm not saying this to be mean or to fear monger and you might even be thinking to yourself that I don't know you or your bf so it doesn't matter. And that's true, I don't know you two. 

Reread your post and imagine someone else wrote it. Take in what he's doing to you when your relationship is still actively going on. This is when he's supposed to love you and treat you with respect.  He's supposed to be your life partner and support you through difficult times.

Now imagine what someone like that would do if he knew he was losing his control over you. Financial abuse is still abuse. It still shows that the abuser can do terrible things.

- What expenses should be split between the both of you (usually rent, utilities, food, dates, any other shared expenses).
- what the split will be (I suggest proportional based on income or take home pay) 
- how to track these (there are apps like splitwise and settle up, or you could put shared expenses in an excel spreadsheet at the end of the month, or you could open a shared bank account and each put your portion into it, but each keep the rest of your finances separate)
