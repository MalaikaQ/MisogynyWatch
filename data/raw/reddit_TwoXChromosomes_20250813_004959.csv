n8c2dz6,1moghya,TwoXChromosomes,NowGoodbyeForever,"Not for nothing, but it just sounds like...**she wasn't straight?** And then dated someone who was a better partner and also fit within the bounds of who she was attracted to.

Every single queer person I know had a chunk of their life where they **thought they were straight.** And while heteronormativity is a genuine issue that robs people of knowing their full selves earlier in life, this doesn't really seem to be what this article is getting at. Honestly, I'm not sure what the author is trying to convey at all.

(Well, I have a pretty good idea: The profile subject is the author of a new buzz-y book, and this whole piece is part of the marketing rollout.)

I am incredibly happy for her. But **it does feel like a white woman left her husband, found a dope Black Wife, and is possibly acting like she invented Bisexuality via Economics.** I find this especially interesting in the section where she talks about doing chores and tasks for her wife, vs. for her husband.

She acknowledges that she would do things like steam her husband's shirt before work, and it would feel like an obligation under patriarchy. But when she does it for her wife, it's a loving care task. I struggle to see how this is an exclusive issue of her shitty ex being a man vs. her shitty ex being shitty.

And, again: I fully recognize that what's being alluded to here is **how the grand majority of men are socially comfortable with** ***being shitty partners*** **and see no strong need to change their ways.** I think we all agree on this, and that's basically what the ""Male Loneliness Epidemic"" is about as well, just from a different angle. Straight men are rarely encouraged to seek out self-improvement or externalizing care as ways to exist, or things that are worth prioritizing to get what *they* want in life.

(Unlike any other minority group, who has to learn ways to coexist and win the favour of the majority to survive.)

I dunno. I'm not articulating my thoughts perfectly here, and I'd love to be called out if any of my takes are wildly incorrect here.

Anyway, everyone has their own path and diverse experience. Either way, it doesn't change the facts of her analysis.

>Steaming her wife’s shirt, for example, “can be a gesture of love and care because she’s super-nervous about her first day, rather than I’m expected to do this because of patriarchy.”


I believe her point here is that she would have been expected to iron her husband's shirt no matter what, because women take care of ironing, regardless of how much they like their husband. 


Whereas in a two-woman relationship, instead of defaulting to gender roles, performing care tasks can be more about caring or even utilitarian reasons (like who has more time), and there's not resentment for doing something because patriarchy says that's your role in this situation.

I completely agree with this analysis. I'm glad she found happiness, but what actionable lesson is there actually to be learned here?

""...by 1971, women who had used the device reported septic infections and other complications that led them to seek serious medical attention. Researchers discovered that the string attached to the Shield was not sealed at the end, causing the string to fray and disintegrate. The string drew vaginal bacteria into the uterus, resulting in septic infection, miscarriage, and an array of other related complications, including death.” - https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/dalkon-shield

n88p4xs,1mo06aq,TwoXChromosomes,uuuuuummmmm_actually,"“Lauren Southern, one of the most well-known right-wing influencers during Donald Trump’s first term, first went viral with a 2015 video titled “Why I Am Not a Feminist.” Then 19, beautiful and blond, Southern argued that women are advantaged in many areas of life, including child custody disputes and escaping abusive relationships. “Feminists are unintentionally creating a world of reverse sexism that I don’t want to be a part of,” she said.

But being an antifeminist, it turns out, is no shield against abusive male power. Southern’s new self-published memoir, “This Is Not Real Life,” is the story of conservative ideology colliding with reality. It’s made headlines for her claim that Andrew Tate, an unrepentant online misogynist accused of human trafficking, sexually assaulted her in Romania in 2018. (Tate has denied this.) The book is particularly revealing, though, for its depiction of Southern’s painful attempts to contort herself into an archetypical tradwife, an effort that left her almost suicidal. Her story should be a cautionary tale for the young women who aspire to the domestic life she once evangelized for.

Despite the presence of a few high-profile women in Trump’s administration, the right is increasingly trying to drive women out of public life. Some of this push comes from the unabashed patriarchs atop the Republican Party; last week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reposted a video in which leaders of his Christian denomination said that women shouldn’t be allowed to vote. (“All of Christ for All of Life,” wrote Hegseth.)

But there are also female influencers who present housewifery as the ultimate in wellness, an escape from the soulless grind of the workplace. “Less Prozac, more protein,” the podcast host Alex Clark told thousands of listeners at a conservative women’s conference in June. “Less burnout, more babies, less feminism, more femininity.” (Clark is unmarried and has no children.)

This Instagram-inflected traditionalism is taking hold at a time when the workplace is becoming even less friendly to women. As The Washington Post reported on Monday, large numbers of mothers have left the work force this year. Many have been driven out by return-to-office mandates and a backlash against diversity policies that’s led to hostile working environments. But some, according to The Post, “say they are giving up jobs happily, in line with MAGA culture and the rise of the ‘traditional wife.’”

Southern had more reason than most to want to retreat into the cult of domesticity. As she recounts in her memoir, her antifeminist video helped propel her to international notoriety, and soon she was traveling the world as an avatar of irreverent online reaction. She gave out fliers saying, “Allah is a Gay God” in a Muslim neighborhood in England, popularized the idea that there’s a white genocide in South Africa and interviewed the reactionary philosopher Alexander Dugin on a trip to Moscow seemingly arranged by shadowy Russian interests.

It was during this phase of her life that she said she was assaulted by Tate, who was just beginning to build his global brand. Her politics made the trauma particularly hard to process. “It wouldn’t be very helpful to ‘the cause’ (or my career, for that matter) for me to become exactly what I criticized,” wrote Southern. “A victim.”

After her encounter with Tate, she wrote, her life “unraveled.” She yearned to escape her own infamy and the need to keep shoveling more outrageous content into the internet’s insatiable maw. So when she met a man who wanted to settle down, she jumped at the chance to give up her career and become a stay-at-home wife and mother. She posted photos of herself baking, and “selfies in the mirror showing how quickly I had bounced back to fitness and health after pregnancy.”

But in reality, she wrote, her life was “hell.” She’d moved with her husband from Canada, where she’d grown up, to his native Australia, where she lived in near-total isolation. Her husband treated her with growing contempt, which she responded to by trying to be an even better wife. “I threw myself tenfold into trying to be the perfect partner: cooking, cleaning, putting on dresses and high heels to welcome him home,” she wrote. But it didn’t work; she said her husband berated her, stayed out until late at night and constantly threatened to divorce her if she didn’t obey him.

Eventually, she wrote, when she defied him by traveling to Canada to visit her family, he told her the marriage was over. By then, she said, she’d turned over much of her savings to him. She and her son had to move in with her parents, and then into a small, cheap cabin in the woods. She was destitute, full of shame and intellectually adrift. As she told the conservative journalist Mary Harrington last year, when she first went public about her experience with trad life, “My brain was breaking between two worlds, because I couldn’t let go of the ideology.”

Southern’s book is not an attempt at liberal redemption. Though she claims she’s lost interest in politics, she doesn’t renounce the ugly nativist views that helped her build her audience. She doesn’t apologize for, say, trying to block a boat that rescued drowning migrants in the Mediterranean. But while she’s not a particularly sympathetic figure, that might make her criticism of trad culture more credible, because it’s hard to see a professional motive in a book that’s likely to annoy every political faction.

Every few decades, it seems, America is fated to endure a new spasm of pseudotraditionalism, with women encouraged to seek shelter from a brutal world in homemaking. The lionization of the housewife in the 1950s came after women were pushed out of their World War II-era jobs. During the 1980s, as Susan Faludi wrote in her classic “Backlash,” women were bombarded with media messages telling them true freedom lay in marriage and motherhood. In 2003, The New York Times Magazine heralded “The Opt-Out Revolution,” part of a wave of media about elite women stepping back from hard-charging careers.

I’m sure some women are happy renouncing their ambitions to care for husbands and children. But often, women who give in to gender retrenchment come to regret it. A decade after “The Opt-Out Revolution,” a Times Magazine headline read, “The Opt-Out Generation Wants Back In.”

In her 2007 book “The Feminine Mistake,” Leslie Bennetts wrote, “I couldn’t possibly count the number of women I’ve interviewed who thought they could depend on a husband to support them but who ultimately found themselves alone and unprepared to take care of themselves — and their children.” It seems particularly dangerous to tie one’s fate to a man who is part of an internet subculture obsessed with female submission.
Unfortunately, the women who most need to hear this message probably won’t listen to middle-aged feminists. They’ll have to wait for it to play out in their own lives, or in the curated lives on their screens.”",6735,2025-08-11 22:33:06,False,A Right-Wing Influencer Tried to Be a Tradwife.

Just FYI, Lauren Southern was a 21 year old globe-trotting adult when she participated in HUMAN TRAFFICKING and ATTEMPTED MURDER of refugees (by blocking their rescue by Doctors Without Borders); who knows if her attempted murder victims did in fact die. The hate group had wanted to sink some of those small vessels of refugees themselves, but were unable to. 

Here's a little more about that incident. From the [Southern Poverty Law Center's article](https://www.splcenter.org/resources/hatewatch/full-ship-behind-generation-identitys-high-seas-publicity-stunt/) (bolds are mine): 

>Defend Europe \[the hate group\] had trouble even getting its ship to the Central Mediterranean. First it was delayed for a full week by Sellner \[the hate group's leader & figurehead\] and company’s inability to produce routine crew paperwork needed to cross the Suez Canal. Then came a disastrous July 27 refueling stop in Famagusta, a city on the east coast of Cyprus. Port inspectors there found 20 Sri Lankan men on board whose crew member identification appeared counterfeit. The inspectors said the men admitted they were not professional seamen. According to the *Guardian*, **the Sri Lankans told local human rights activists they had paid the equivalent of almost $12,000 each to be smuggled to Italy aboard the Defend Europe ship**. Police arrested the ship’s owner, captain, senior officers and Defend Europe activist Alexander Schelyer on **charges related to human trafficking**. After making a court appearance a few days later, they were released for lack of evidence. Defend Europe claimed the Sri Lankan men were “apprentice sailors” rather than “full-fledged crew members” and denied any knowledge of falsified documents. Fifteen of the 20 crew members were deported to Sri Lanka. The other five claimed asylum.

>\[...\]

>On August 7, Defend Europe tried to refuel at Zarzis, Tunisia, but was thwarted by local fishermen who blocked the refueling channel with small boats, waving signs that read, “No racists.”

>\[...\]

>A week later, Defend Europe abruptly ended its “first mission” after being denied entry by port authorities in Malta. After four weeks at sea, Defend Europe had taken zero immigrants into custody, and sunk zero boats.

>Sellner declared victory. “It was a success. Undisputedly. Totally,” he stated.

>One month later, the *C-Star* was still anchored off the coast of Spain with no fuel or functioning navigation equipment. **The nine professional seamen still on board, all Sri Lankans, requested emergency assistance from the Red Cross, which provided them with food, water and jackets. They said they had never been paid.**  
\[prior to the voyage\] Defend Europe \[had\] raised more than $178,000, far exceeding its original crowdfunding goal of $58,000.",52,2025-08-12 04:35:24,False,A Right-Wing Influencer Tried to Be a Tradwife. It Almost Broke Her.,6607,2025-08-11 22:24:40,646,,,,,,[]

At 19, she was still an adolescent by developmental standards, and the article lays out how she was brought into a network of older, more powerful men who benefitted from her platforming their ideology.

That kind of hostility doesn’t usually “snap someone out of it,” it often pushes them deeper into the indoctrination, making it even harder for them to leave. I also worry that, especially if they were raised to believe the way they do, which adds another layer of naivety, they’ll continue to be taken advantage of, and when they are, they’ll be told “you did it to yourself” by the very people who claim to care about gender equality.

And that not meant as an insult to either, just acknowledging that the way a person values themselves plays a role in what they think they deserve. So women with low self esteem are more likely to end up in controlling/abusive relationships and age gap relationships.

Financial independence. Friendship networks. Employable skills. Social reputation. Physical and mental health. All forms of power, and all things women are so often encouraged to consider less important than someone else's.

So, why not take the tradwife deal? Because a) the exchange rate for buying male power with female power is absolute balls, and b) that borrowed power can be lost in an instant. Personal, owned power can too, of course -- but by disasters or sickness, not by someone else's whim.

n8acurb,1mo06aq,TwoXChromosomes,ageofbronze,"Hmm yeah I think about this a lot because while many of the trad wife influencers are incredible hypocrites, I fear that I do completely understand how women get radicalized into believing in trad wife ideals and get sucked in to perpetuating the bullshit. Only because to be a mother without support in the US is so lonely and difficult, and capitalism grinds people down. For new moms who are trying to balance motherhood with work, especially work that doesn’t provide proper benefits like flexibility around scheduling, I could see how it is the most appealing thing in the world for someone to say: just let go of your stressors, lean in to a soft life, shouldn’t you be able to focus on your kids and not corporate pettiness or the stress of a fast food job? 

Like i get it, the trad wife shit is so couched in deceptive language because of what it promises, all to young women who maybe haven’t had the chance yet to be at the mercy of an abusive relationship (or in a way that they are directly aware of) and literally can’t understand yet yet of what it means to place your life and autonomy in a man’s hands and the danger and self destruction there. This is not to excuse any of it, and very much many of the bigger trad wife influencers who have a huge following, like ballerina farm, are aware they are WORKING and using their voices selling a lie and selling women’s oppression for their own material gains, all while saying women should no longer be allowed to work or vote, so I don’t excuse them or anything. But I see tons of young girls who don’t have any life experience hopping on the train once they get married young and have kids, and it breaks my heart because what they need is better social safety nets and workers rights, trad wife is just co-opting that need and distorting it to something unrecognizable that hurts women. 

It’s a wretched cycle because by the time they get spit back out, they’re the “older” women who won’t be listened to if they speak out, or they’re not speaking out and are still in it but are so miserable they wish the same thing upon their own daughters. I feel like all we can do is try and combat the trad wife sphere with as much anti-trad wide media as possible, not even just directly condemning it (which it should be, but that probably will sail over their ears since they convince themselves we’re all just bitter unmarried hags), but offers a different explanation and solution for their alienation and tries to pull them out of it before they get sucked in. and always fight for more support for the mothers and children, more worker’s rights for everyone, more education.",4,2025-08-12 06:40:35,False,A Right-Wing Influencer Tried to Be a Tradwife.

Like I explained to someone else earlier, this woman is anti feminist but her actions and views are not a minority view for white women overall. Refer back to my second paragraph on how white women voters have historically been right leaning, including recent elections. Miss Southern and White Feminism share in the idea that they only look out for their own White self interests. After all, White Feminism™️ (not to be confused with feminists who happen to be white), will never actually carry feminist values. I am not saying white feminists are at fault and have even pointed out the trademark as the common differation between White Feminist ™️ and white women who are feminists. However if that is your takeaway, I’d urge some reflection. I’m saying what Miss Southern has done reflects the pattern many white women and White Feminism carry on.

And now my Internet is being stupid. Anyway, anecdotes:

- I tried to start a local online mens group in my cities online space. I was the only one contributing, except the guy who posted negging women for not behaving like men to dick pics 
- look at most men centered reddit groups
- a man friend took over the online group and started in person meetings. I stayed on at first to help mentor him, as I had experience running groups..the first conversation in that group was: what's the point if women don't see us? What's the point of we can't immediately make sweeping massive social change? The men who need it won't be here (said by men who: sexually harassed a woman half his age out of STEM mentorship and refuses to acknowledge he did that - hi Scott!; stalked his ex gf and wants to learn to braid ""pretty white girl hair"" to increase his access to women; had a hissy fit bc I banned him from my photo shoots after he followed women around, pressured them for sexual information, waited outside the changing room and whistoed when women came out, and thought all this was fine bc he didn't touch anyone. 
- the man leading the group burnt out in 3 months bc the majority of the men there were being performative and basically trying to use the group to gaslight their women and be better abusers 
- I know/knew two men personally who went to therapy specifically to become better at manipulation 
- I work in a therapy office, it is pulling teeth to get men, and so many wives try to get their husbands in
- men have systemic privilege and are in charge, if they cared about other men, they would do things to help thing. Unfortunately, the majority of men in power seem to think helping men requires oppressing women, so instead of larger scale support for men, we see movements to remove rights of women.

n89fdb1,1mo06aq,TwoXChromosomes,Untoastedchampange,"No. You’re collapsing political responsibility into criminal culpability. Supporting bad ideas ≠ causing a man to rape you. Calling her assault an “obvious consequence” of her campaigning is a false equivalence and a non sequitur. Plenty of women who oppose patriarchy are raped; plenty who support it aren’t. Risk isn’t causation, and it isn’t moral blame.

You’re also mixing categories. Democratic accountability is collective (votes, policies). Criminal responsibility is individual. Blurring them lets you punish the victim for someone else’s crime. And “with power comes responsibility” cuts the other way here: a wealthy older man exploited a 22 year old. He had the power and made the choice.

Finally, you contradict yourself. You say “the rapist is still the rapist,” then split blame with her anyway. Critique her politics all you want; hold her to account for harms she’s done. But the assault is 100% on the man who committed it. That’s what rejecting victim blaming looks like.",4,2025-08-12 02:45:53,False,A Right-Wing Influencer Tried to Be a Tradwife.

n89lc5f,1mo06aq,TwoXChromosomes,gSTrS8XRwqIV5AUh4hwI,"> No. You’re collapsing political responsibility into criminal culpability.

Well, they simply are inseparably linked.

> Supporting bad ideas ≠ causing a man to rape you.

Except ... yes, it is. If the bad ideas that you support are specifically opposed to things that would reduce rape, then you are obviously a causal factor in rape happening at a higher rate, and thus with some probability in you yourself being raped.

If that weren't so, then all of feminism would be nonsense, as the point of feminism is, or so I'd think, to be a causal factor in reducing all kinds of unwelcome things, among them rape, and if that's not just a delusion, then opposition to feminism is a causal factor in keeping those things as they are (/making them worse).

> Calling her assault an “obvious consequence” of her campaigning is a false equivalence and a non sequitur.

How so?

> Plenty of women who oppose patriarchy are raped; plenty who support it aren’t.

Yeah ... so?

> Risk isn’t causation, and it isn’t moral blame.

Except ... yeah, it is?

> Democratic accountability is collective (votes, policies). Criminal responsibility is individual.

I don't agree.

> Blurring them lets you punish the victim for someone else’s crime.

No. If you enable abusers, then that is your crime, no the abuser's. This has nothing to do with her being the victim. She has put effort into enabling the sort of behavior, and that she bears responsibility for, for all the victims that were the result of her campaigning. It's just coincidental that she herself also happens to be one of the victims.

> And “with power comes responsibility” cuts the other way here: a wealthy older man exploited a 22 year old. He had the power and made the choice.

Yeah, obviously!? All dictators have the choice to not do the things that dictators do. That doesn't change that if people didn't elect the dictator that was obviously going to be a dictator, then they woudln't be a dictator and their choice would be irrelevant.

The whole point of democracy is to protect against the danger of the wrong person getting too much power. That's not excusing people who would abuse that power, but it is the result of recognizing that such people exist and we as society have the responsibility of not letting them gain the power, and ""we as society"" means every last one of us.

> Finally, you contradict yourself. You say “the rapist is still the rapist,” then split blame with her anyway.

Nope, I don't split any blame. I add more blame. Which is why I said that it doesn't excuse anything. The rapist doesn't get to be treated any better because he had enablers. He doesn't get a lighter sentence because he had enablers. He is fully responsible for what he did. But the enabler is also fully responsible for their contribution to enabling the behavior.

> Critique her politics all you want; hold her to account for harms she’s done. But the assault is 100% on the man who committed it.

She can't have done any harm if there is no causal connection between her politics and what happened.

I mean, let's swap her to a male billionaire donating hundreds of millions to Trump ... is he responsible for increased rates of rape? And if so, then why isn't she?

> That’s what rejecting victim blaming looks like.

You aren't being serious, are you?

Now, I don't have any first-hand knowlegde of what this Tate guy is saying, but going by what you tend to hear about him ... yeah, he certainly is not excusing his own behavior with that at all. He certainly is making almost the same argument that I am making. /s

> Your claim collapses two distinct categories: political accountability and criminal culpability.

You just repeating your claim doesn't make you more right.

> You also commit a false equivalence: voting for, supporting, or amplifying a harmful ideology is not the same act, legally or morally, as committing rape.

So ... good that I didn't say anything of the sort, then?

> At most, you could argue it increases statistical risk, but risk ≠ causation,

That's trivial, and irrelevant. You don't get to free yourself from responsibility simply by diluting it to the point that direct causation in each individual case gets impossible to prove.

> and causation ≠ culpability.

Equally trivial, and irrelevant. Just because causation and culpability aren't the same thing, doesn't mean that causation doesn't play an important role in culpability. Other important factors are whether you could have avoided doing the thing that caused the outcome, and whether you can be expected to know that doing the thing would with some appropriate probability lead to the outcome. Neither of those is in her favor here.

> If your logic held, then anyone in any political movement where abuse later occurs would “share” responsibility for that abuse, which is untenable.

No, it wouldn't, and it is obvious that you are strawmanning my position. The abuse in/from/as a result of the political movement that she supported (and still supports, it seems?) hasn't ""occured later"" as mere conicidence. It is the completely predictable result of the central goals of the movement. And, see above, that is very relevant for culpability, and even moreso for responsibility.

This isn't ""we were demonstrating for world peace and the organizer turned out to be a piece of shit"". This is ""we demonstrated against accountability for rape ... and then rape happened"".

> The “she enabled abusers” framing ignores the systemic power dynamics outlined in the article. She was 19 when she entered a network of older, wealthier men who directly funded and shaped her work. At 22, she was raped by Tate, a man with vastly more financial, social, and physical power. That is a clear exploitation of an unequal power relationship, not a case of two political equals colluding in harm.

The same would apply for Tate, then, wouldn't it? He certainly was subject to systemic power dynamics and a network of people who directly funded and shaped his work ...

And at the same time, she used her position of relative power to influence impressionable girls into following the same shitty ideology, or so I think? (edit: and boys, too, I'd imagine ...) I mean, I am not directly familiar with her work either, but that seems to be the sort of thing she was doing?!

I mean, it's not that your analysis is wrong, but I don't see how that removes responsibility. All it does it that it adds more responsibility for more people. Which was obvious anyway.

> Finally, your argument contains an internal contradiction: you state “the rapist is still the rapist,” yet assign her partial blame, which negates that first statement. By your reasoning, responsibility for the crime is not fully with the perpetrator, which is precisely the definition of victim blaming.

Again, just repeating your claim and ignoring my response doesn't make you more right.

> Accountability for harmful views can and should mean loss of credibility, audience, and influence. It does not, and cannot, ethically include being abused.

This has nothing to do with accountability. Noone is suggesting that being raped is a method for holding people accountable or whatever it is that you are trying to insinuate. But that doesn't change that she is responsible for the outcome that she worked to make happen.

Then the whole company basically forgets about me as long as my 3 morning grids are emailed by noon.

I am copied on HUNDREDS of daily emails but none are tasks or assignments for me. Once in a while I have a slammed week or two and then back to this. Full (rather decent) salary, full benefits, flexibility.. they just want me in my lane, not knowing ANYTHING outside of what they need/want me to know.. regardless of how much I can contribute.

This is not a humble brag. I’m literally miserable… I have an MBA, looking to pursue a doctorate.. I’ve run my own teams and projects.. my husband runs the house, his own biz (excels at both too) and finally said to me last year: just coast until they realize… but my brain cells are dead.

When I interview at way more interesting places, it’s always “hybrid” and that ALWAYS means “4 days in, fridays wfh” so I ALWAYS pass.

The thought of being at home is a nightmare for me. The thought of continuing in this uninspired existence is also a nightmare for me… where is the balance man??

Ugh thanks for coming to my TED talk.. I hate this timeline.

Edit: many years ago my hubs sat me down (after listening to me negotiate a salary for a new gig) and told me to negotiate like a man. And then SHOWED me. So I started doing it, and sometimes I got more $$ and often told no (that’s fine, bye) but being mostly remote is non negotiable. When offered hybrid I always say “I’m a much more diligent worker at 3days office/2 days at home because of XYZ” and have yet to be given grace with that.

When i did live near an office, I went in anyway to see coworkers, so do with that what you will). The sacrifice they are making on talent is so mind blowing. We've had seniro level, multiple 6 figure roles be open for almost years at a time bc there is not that specific skill set existing in our office locations, whereas if we just hired remote we'd get an amazing candidate quickly from anywhere in the world.

A lot of corporations are mandating RTO, despite not having enough office space for all their workers, because it's a way to do mass layoffs without having to pay out severance, pay unemployment, etc.  They get rid of head count without officially using the 'L' word because some people don't live near an office or they refuse to go back to the office.  Other campanies do it for bookkeeping tricks, because empty office buildings are liabilities on the accounting sheet, but full office buildings are operating costs.

n8bl9b8,1mo4f9m,TwoXChromosomes,NoSignificance1903,"Even if you spend an entire after-tax salary on childcare, you’re still gaining a lot. You’re maintaining opportunities for advancement, paying into retirement, and potentially receiving other benefits. Once the kids are in school, you won’t be paying for daycare. I agree the cost of childcare needs to come down drastically (I think the most practicable option to avoid issues with snowballing prices in response to subsidies is to just integrate it into the public education system) but even as it is it’s still worth it to work.

In the same vein, public schools should provide after school care until at least 6 PM (likely later in exurban towns with large populations of commuters). We could devote some of that time to additional education (improving outcomes).

Even from a purely economic perspective (and that is far from the only justification), creating a society where talented women are unable to perform valuable work because of childcare responsibilities hurts overall productivity. Additionally, it is overall better for the economy to have trained professionals caring for many children at once than to have all their mothers leave the workforce.

During all of that I went to grab some food at the shop next to ours. A gal my age asked if I worked with the creep and if I knew anything about him as he had asked her out. All I said was “just be careful” took my food and left. A few days later the creep texted me a picture of my bedroom window and threatened to blow my parent’s house up if I ever said his name again.

Your partner should want to support you in whatever way they can, and if you’re supporting them through health issues, this can give them the opportunity to support you too. You don’t have to feel alone in this. 

To help keep yourself calm in the moment, maybe try some box breathing, in for 4, hold for 4, out for 4, hold for 4, repeat. 

There’s also sensory grounding. Name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste. 

Also, grounding phrases can be helpful. “I am safe now. This fear belongs in the past. The shame I feel belongs to him and not me.”

I highly recommend trauma-informed therapy if you have access. If not, the book Complex PTSD by Pete Walker has been immensely helpful for me on my healing journey.

I can only speak to my experience, which seems to be “atypical.” 

My sorority had more diversity than the local population, and we had openly out members (though I cannot speak to their experiences with that). Most of us were poor college students, though some of course came from more money. We devoted a lot of energy to philanthropic work related to supporting women, and for medical research for a degenerative disease that a member has. 

That said, there is a lot of toxic rape culture mixed into the system. Change would be a good thing here, especially with how little oversight the Panhellenic org has. Policies are often more driven by alumni who have a vested interest in keeping things the same. Sororities have a history of racism, elitism, and conservatism that shows up in small and big ways today. 

I benefited from the sorority by saving money and being able to live with women, where there was a sense of sisterhood (despite the desire to paint women as catty mean girls). But even while trying to fight the awful sorority stereotypes, we still engaged in them on some level—especially around drinking culture and assimilation.

I used to work at a state university. The fact that you think anyone can afford college is very confusing and telling of your personal position in life. 

Sororities are very much more expensive. The fact that you have dues and fees for various things and have a required minimum cost level to get in immediately sets it apart and makes it much more expensive. It is an optional thing, not a necessity.

A sorority can cost at min an additional $1000 per semester if you don’t live in the house and the school is cheap. Not everyone can afford the cost of college…let alone that additional fee for social purposes. 

I have the same criticism of fraternities, so your argument about it being misogynistic is without value.

You can cancel a lease, but you will need to be able to pay a lease break fee OR potentially have a paper trail like a restraining order. It might be best to try and file a restraining order so you can then call the cops on him again for breaking the restraining order.

Invest in the ability to lock your bedroom door at night. And some mace or bear spray. Keep one by the door and one in your bedroom.

This guy is unstable, yes. But you are not the person he's interested in. He's almost certainly not going to follow you. If anything, your presence may be the actual proof he needs to finally accept that you and your bf are not the people he's looking for. 


I'm not saying you shouldn't be scared--that's totally rational. But after interacting with the police, and seeing the camera, and time, there's at least a possibility this guy will finally understand the other tenant is gone. 


Have you talked to your landlord about this guy? Is it possible he's already been trespassed and the police can take further steps? 


There are devices that can provide security beyond a door lock; I have an Addalock but there are others. They can only be used when someone is home. 


I guess I'm thinking him picking the lock (which is still difficult, assuming you have a deadbolt) is more likely than kicking down a metal door. Having an extra layer of security might help you feel safer until the situation is resolved.

However, he had no boundaries. He was not ashamed of his behavior. He did not operate according to behavioral norms. He was dangerous. I was a prisoner in my house.

I’ve been a fireman for decades and have taken out I can’t tell you how many doors. The vast majority I could have simply kicked in *even with the deadbolts engaged* because the vast majority of the time you can send both the dead bolt and thumb latch straight through the frame. 

The biggest pain in the ass to get around though is removing the bullshit screws that hold the strike plates onto the door frames from both the latch and the dead bolt and replacing them with the absolute longest screws you can find. Long enough to make a purchase into the 2x4’s (or 2x6’s) that constitute the frame around the door opening (the frame that’s holding your door frames in place.) You can still force your way through that but it’s a pain in the ass and you probably aren’t doing it without tools, you definitely aren’t doing it quickly, and you sure as hell aren’t doing it without making a shit load of noise.

And depending on the state, she may not be able to get a restraining order against him unless he *actually* believes he's at the wrong address. It's not a crime to knock on the wrong door. This is why when the police came the first time they just gave him a warning and didn't give her his name.

And even if she gets a restraining order against him, she has to give her name and information to him.

Basically no matter what, she has to confront this guy. I'm saying to do it in a controlled situation and not in an escalating way like a door kicked down because he thinks his ex gf is cheating or whatever or a restraining order that he'll probably ignore based on his criminal record.

If she interacts with him again, even through a ring doorbell, and has it on video stating that he’s at the wrong address and to stop harassing her then that’s evidence right there. If he comes back and she gets that on video then that’s the nail in the coffin as far as that’s concerned. 

And with his criminal record it’s more likely than not that a judge will grant it esp if she manages to get any sort of evidence. Even the prior police calls/reports will be taken into account too.

n8bnli8,1moeim8,TwoXChromosomes,Gaias_Minion,"I'd like for you to have in mind that the ""not loving you"" is fully on his part.

On one hand, it's a common tactic for people like him to get the ""upper hand"" when things end.  
In many cases it's because they can't deal with a hit to their ego, so they try to shrug it off, similar to those cases of men flirting with women, getting rejected and Immediately switching to bs like ""You're ugly anyways, who'd date you, I was just doing you a favor"", etc.  
  
Other cases, they Are hurt and want to hurt You one last time as well, still showing they're not mature enough to properly own up to what they did, and instead use this as like a distraction, as if everything they did is now invalid and you don't get to complain about it.



On the other hand, if he does mean it, it is on his part as well.

If you don't love someone, you communicate so things can end better and both of you could've found other people. But instead HE CHOSE to not be honest about it and keep you along until you reached your breaking point (maybe he even expected you to Not reach a breaking point).  
You didn't ask for it, you didn't want it, but His actions led to it so he has no one to blame but himself, except people like him will never accept the blame and rather to try to turn things around against you.

  
So whether he falls on one or the other, again it's on his part, and you were able to stand your ground and end things so, you should be proud of being able to end things with someone like that, and hopefully now you'll be able to leave him behind from good, and go onto find the actual happiness that you deserve.",78,2025-08-12 10:35:34,False,My ex stayed with me despite not loving me anymore.,101,2025-08-12 10:07:37,21,,,,,,[]

This and the fact he couldn't handle you crying on a surprise hike when you're sick (not to mention the partying) shows this guy is quite immature. 


I would recommend looking into what makes healthy boundaries; I like ""Boundaries After a Pathological Relationship"" by Adelyn Birch, which is a very quick read, but if you search for ""boundaries"" on this sub you should find several recommendations. 


Recognizing healthy boundaries and how to set (and respect) them will help you see more clearly when someone is not respecting your boundaries, so you can more quickly get out of toxic situations. It also makes it easier to see what is and what is not your responsibility. 


I also like nonviolent communication (NVC) in general, but especially for having difficult conversations. 


You have been trained by your childhood to gravitate towards people who want you to be small, because that's what's most familiar to you. You deserve to find someone who loves your big, loud--or quiet!--whole self.

He came back to you because he realized that partying with friends is fun but you come home to no one. He was just good at masking his loneliness so you’d take him back. And being too loud or too angry or too quiet is called having emotions. NEVER let someone else dictate your feelings or emotions or how you express those feelings or emotions.

LOL!!!! I’m sorry but what an absolute fucking man child. That alone proves to me that his opinion of you is worthless and he has the emotional intelligence of a peanut.

Some people just have low standards for their lives. Instead of waiting for a partner that they’re head over heels in love with, they settle for the safe/comfortable option. Or when they fall out of love, they don’t care enough to walk away. They don’t have the motivation to strive for better, they’re lazy and complacent. They settle for a “good enough” relationship because it’s easier than going out and looking for a great one. They also don’t care to do the work on themselves required to be a great partner. So of course their relationships will not be great.

n88h3ue,1mnminv,TwoXChromosomes,limelifesavers,"I remember after the right wing religious shits lost the case on marriage equality, their orgs and politicians and donors got together to gameplan the plan forward. It was a public event, it was well documented, they laid their strategy and talking points and motivations bare. I remember so many trans women raising the alarm for this, but people were too busy celebrating.

""But no,"" people would say. ""You're exaggerating. You're overreacting. That would be completely unrealistic, don't worry about it.""

Over the past decade-plus, I've watched them unroll and enact their gameplan point by telegraphed point. Watched them use weasel words and initiate moral panics to manipulate the populace, and push a windbag of a president into power twice,to help distract and cloak what they were doing behind the scenes.  

We knew their exact argument against Roe v Wade years before they got that ball rolling. We knew they would use trans rights and privacy as trojan horses to strip away trans rights and healthcare, women's rights and healthcare, children's rights and healthcare. We knew they'd push to splinter the LGB demographic away from trans folks, and would use the fight against trans rights to set up their arguments to repeal Obergefell. We watched them put justices in position to ascend to the Supreme Court that were sympathetic to their wide array of views. They rolled back the longstanding EOs won by the civil rights movement decades ago that were never fought within the democratic or republican parties to be enshrined legally. We already know they're coming for Brown, Griswold, Lawrence, etc. in the coming months. 

There was no real hiding it. They did it in broad daylight, and most people just assumed the best from them, for whatever reason, and that they wouldn't do it if given the opportunity. 

It's stunning how many Americans don't already understand they're in the middle of a civil war. Who still believe the rule of law will protect them, when it's discarded, rewritten, and ignored daily by the powers that be. The right ring fascists sure understand it, they've talked about it openly for years now. Some of the democrats caught on, but have restricted themselves through rote procedure and decorum, and seem all too happy to let the GOP do what it wants, expecting people fill flood back to vote for them next election. Assuming another election will happen, and that it won't be significantly impeded on and interfered with by the GOP, as we've already been seeing since Biden's original win.

They're going to try and stop new marriages from happening. If you're already married they (currently) can't strip you of that right.


The US doesn't keep a marriage registration list. That's up to where you get married. So states or counties keep these lists. 


I got married in another country. The state didn't care to get a copy. They just accepted I was married & I got 5x copies just in case I need to provide proof to anyone.


If states do start refusing to license same sex marriage, you could just get married in another state or country where it's legal. 


If thats the case, do red states have to recognize that marriage as legitimate?


If I lived in a state that got rid of protection, I'd probably make sure my wills, Power of Attorney, and any other banking / legal docs were updated & kept on hand with multiple copies. Get a lawyer in case you/your spouse is in an accident & the hospital refuses to give you POA. Call or trip in from an attorney should resolve that quickly.

I absolutely hated the baby stage, especially newborn. I felt so suffocated, like it was almost piercing silence. I was depressed, isolated. One time my mom FaceTimed me and I got so excited for adult contact, but she asked to see the baby and when it clicked even my mom forgot about me over the exciting baby, I bawled my eyes out. Blubbering. Snot, drool. She was shocked because she thought I was rocking motherhood. I was just doing a good job at outwardly presenting myself well so nobody knew how badly I was struggling. 

Fill that silence with YOU. Play your music, your movies/shows/podcast, puzzles and art, work yourself into your new life. Talk on the phone to friends to fill that silence (if you/them enjoy that). My son is 4 now and besides the schedule restraint, I still have all of my old hobbies and life, but I worked to make that happen. It's easy to forget yourself when a small human needs you to survive. You know that mental checklist in your head that's all of the baby's needs right now? Throw YOURS in there too. They're not negotiable. You can make it work. It's not perfect, it's not the independent and sacred alone time we got before with ourselves, but it's a new level of love and intimacy when you indulge in your self-care habits while caring for your child too. My son loves all of my ""me"" things, so not only do I get to do them still, I have little best friend enjoying the fun with me. 

Please reach out. Friends, family, your in-laws, your spouse, church, I don't know, whatever people you have in your life, reach out and verbally tell them you are struggling and need help and human companionship.

Then you have your baby, you are absolutely in love and so is everyone else. All the focus is on the baby. There is no more anticipation for the due date, no more planning, no more constant OB visits. Instead the medical visits are about the baby, the talk is about the baby, everyone wants to hold the baby, hear about what they are doing, if they are sleeping, how they are eating.   Yet you are still there, right in front of everyone, but no one sees you. Your pregnancy is over, you aren’t the focus, the baby is. And you wonder how you fit in, and you want to be seen and heard. 

Christmas morning everyone opens there presents, the kids give a quick thanks, you visit, you have a great meal, then everyone leaves and you have a dirty kitchen to show for it, decorations to take down, and no one there to help. You have built up the excitement of the holidays and now they are over, so where do you go from here?

Your feelings are normal. You aren’t being selfish. You are stating an entire new chapter in your life and trying to figure out where you fit in.

Other comments have made excellent points, and I will try not to duplicate.  

Your feelings are very normal.  Firstly, because YOUR focus is so on that perfect wee person, that it's easy to think that everyone else's is, too. Even if they're not, your world is that babe.  It always FEELS like they are about the babe too. That is human nature.  We seek out a common interest, even if it's not always there.

Having said that, the people you are spending time with are likely loving you, and therefore loving the child too. So, yes - they're probably forgetting that you exist.  Your greatest priority is the babe, and therefore THEIR greatest priority.

I became ""Mom is nuts"".  But harmless.

I have always had a wicked, cheeky, sense of humor, often silly.  I realized that #1 child did too.  So I stopped being who I THOUGHT a ""Mom"" should be, and became the Mom I AM.

It's hard with a potato who eats, poops, sleeps.  But ... #2 child ... I realized that I could make fun of her in a healthy way. Not mean.  Always gentle. But I didn't have to take being a Mom SO SERIOUSLY.

Yeah, I was the maintenance parent, always responsible, adult, competent.  But I could also do it MY WAY.

An example ... I didn't do baby talk because it didn't come naturally to me.  So, my kids knew, used, and understood some big words, at a young age. With no pretence or hubris.  It was just how we talked.  It was MY WAY.

As for the sense of humor ... My kids STILL say ""My Mom is nuts.""  And they do it with a little smile. Because, damn! Did I laugh a lot. Situations that an awful lot of Mom's would have been mad about?  I saw the humor.  I saw the creative kid thought. I saw that not laughing would be ridiculous. So I laughed.  I was a hard ass about some things, but mostly I laughed.  

I still do.  Because that's ME.

I don't know if it will work for you... But this is what I did and it helped me enormously.

I had a comfy baby wrap that was magic for newborns just a hand tie bamboo one so I didn't have to fuss around with a stroller, I had a comfy backpack as a nappy bag and me and my firstborn as a newborn would go on adventures just the two of us. Just day trips doing things I wanted to do. Bush walks hanging out in nature drawing cool bugs, going to the museum, the library, cool cafe to get a big ole milkshake. It was me and my little bud... We watched game of thrones together- she was an incredible patient listener to all my theories, I read her lord of the rings, I painted, I crocheted us matching beanies. She was my little matey- she still is. I had her slung to me while I volunteered doing tree planting and waterway clean ups, I made friends, friends that weren't trying to find their footing with me in my transition into being a mum. 

The thing is most people around you when you go through the transition will be so excited about the new addition and will remind you of how your life must revolve around the baby- and it does... But the baby's life also revolves around you. There's a mutuality. And you both deserve the joys of the world and to shine together. I now have 4 kids and we still do all that stuff together. They have confidence, interests, opinions and skill sets all developed because they were a participant in the world right from the get go and I'd like to hope because they had a mum that demonstrated how to be a whole human.

n890w1t,1mnku7x,TwoXChromosomes,ATrueLady,"I know that feeling all too well.  It was a real struggle with my second.  There's the part of you and baby that is attached hormonally, especially if you are a SAHM.  Then there's the social aspect.  Everyone who wants to see you also really wants to see baby.  You feel like an entity combined.  And baby does need you.  All the time.  Constantly.  Screen time is also a double edged sword.  Do I put on Mrs. Rachel so I can go transplant a plant, or do I sit and attend to needy baby who has all needs met but is crying for no reason?  Eventually I found that Mrs. Rachel is good in small doses, but the songs got grating to hear so much, and I decided it was better for baby to have less screen time, which meant more attachment.  And then they start crawling.  And you need too watch them very carefully.  So when baby's asleep and the house is still?  You feel gone.  

  
It takes a while, or it did for me with my second, but soon they get a little more independent, and you can start to do your own thing a little bit again.  It's still a balancing act though, like I don't get to tend my garden and work on projects as much as I might like sometimes. My second is extremely needy and I am working on this.  But it DOES get better.  You do feel like yourself again.

Also if you're a first time mom, it might not happen again with a second child.  It didn't happen with my first like this.  A lot has to do with baby's personality.

I let my world get very small and very lonely while my kids were growing up. Heck my parents never reached out except to ask about the kids, or to spend time with the kids (and maybe I can come along) while my sister who doesn't have kids would go on awesome vacations with them and I wouldn't even be invited (probably couldn't go but I didn't get asked) so it can bring up lots of feelings that can persist.

I'm working two jobs right now (Thanks for the economy America) but I'm still working on it. Making personal time, doing small hobby projects I like, scheduling time with friends. Doing things I want to do regardless of what the teens want they can drive themselves where they need to go. It gets better but you need to be intentional about it. 

Those feelings can also be symptoms of PPD depression is more than sadness, loneliness, guilt and extra worry all can be symptoms of depression or anxiety. Talk to your doctor about it.  Maybe think about therapy, the good thing about newborns is that they can go to therapy with you until they are super mobile, they aren't going to internalize anything, and you don't sound like you dislike being a mother in general just that you need some support to get through the big changes in your life.",2,2025-08-11 18:54:57,False,I believed I was prepared to become a mother.

I feel for you. I am not a mother myself. I am an unmarried, childless 41 year old man.

I did watch my best friend (38f) express the exact same sentiments. It was absolutely heartbreaking.

This probably won't help, but my best friend's youngest just turned 9 (oldest is 14.5), and it's only been in the last few years that she's finally been really sparking into life as ""herself"" again. Truly making significant strides to pursue hobbies and interests again. The life has returned, and my best friend is blowing my mind with how wonderful she is (and always was, but so much was masked.)

Don't get me wrong: her husband and I have been working to help her not lose herself since she first expressed that feeling of having lost herself. We did things we knew she enjoyed: played board, card, or video games. Watched shows and movies together. Pursued everyday interests and random curiosities. But there was always a sort of veil over her.

I'm sure some of it was postpartum depression. Some was just the overwhelming ON of being Mom. Some was circumstantial, like being a SAHM with a husband who worked nights for a while and a best friend who worked during the day, so there was no way to get away easily for any length of time. No convemient babysitter. No relief.

I guess all I can say is that you are still a marvel or a person and deserve to be a priority.

n8dibwq,1mnku7x,TwoXChromosomes,Clear-Board-7940,"So reading this amazing wall of comments upvotes and validation. It made me think ‘why aren’t we told this will happen?’. Just like, why aren’t we told so many of the other fundamental pragmatic truths of living in these times, in nuclear partnerships (not Kinship groups) under capitalism. 

I feel like there are quite a few problems within this. We are coerced into motherhood without even the written consent and structural support you would get if you had an operation - like a team around you making sure all the elements come together - plus warnings about all the things that can go wrong.

Also, late stage capitalism is a rough time to raise a baby. Reproducing is fundamental priority every species. However extractive systems have devalued it, made it invisible and unpaid. 

Darcia Narvaez, a well respected Child Development Professor (voted in the top 2% of scientists worldwide) researches how children thrive. They thrive in an evolved nest of community. None of us thrive in isolated nuclear household’s. They are isolating and fragile. 

Raising children is supposed to be done in a group, with lots of people around who all consider themselves responsible for helping raise the children around them. This has been found to be what children need to thrive. Since we are so child focused in the way we look at this, I’d say the quiet bit is that this is what mothers also need to thrive.

There is so much that could be said about this from a big picture perspective. Darcia Narvaez has her own website ‘The Evolved Nest’ and is also a major contributor to a great US Parenting website called ‘Kindred Media’ founded and edited by Lisa Reagan (I put her name in, as it helps bring up the site more easily). Anyway, both great resources for the big picture stuff.

I definitely agree with putting effort into yourself/your hobbies. Also remember that raising kids is done in phases - some are easier and some are harder. But establishing that you are a whole independent human outside of being a mother needs to start early. Start early with your partner doing independent childcare and spend time with friends or doing a hobby out of the house. Find good babysitters (whether family or otherwise) and use them for kid free time with your partner. This was a thing that was so hard for us when mine were little and we were broke but it is worth it. Spend the money on the babysitter and pack a picnic dinner for example.

It takes work though. You need to find ways to include yourself in the daily routine. We’re avid Dungeons and Dragons players and I didn’t know how I was going to make that happen with a baby.

Try audiobooks. Love to cook? Wear that baby and explain to them what you’re doing while you do it. Hiking? Get that kid in a stroller and hit the (paved) trails.

n86jxsw,1mnku7x,TwoXChromosomes,ParamedicLimp9310,"Yes! This is a great time to ask yourself who you'd like to be going forward. Do things that you like still just because you like them. Don't sweat it if it gets interrupted by baby care, just make sure you make time to pick it back up when you're feeling it again. 

I didn't do any of this and it hurt my soul so much. Plus my partner at the time was not understanding or supportive about it at all. I told him I felt like I didn't even exist as me but as a food and diaper changing machine. He essentially told me to snap out of it and do stuff for him with a happy face on then he referred to the whole feeling as my ""mommy identity crisis"" and called my friend to ""fix"" me. I was in my early 20s at the time and felt like I had just found myself only to lose myself all over again. It sucked. And for the record, current me (39) would not put up with that crap from anybody. It was a pattern of disrespect and lack of concern from that partner which escalated to the point where it eventually could not be ignored, but at the time I didn't know all that. Anyways, a supportive partner through the highs and lows of parenting is certainly helpful. 

All that to say that even if you don't make time for you, your partner sucks, and everything is on fire... It still gets better. I'm a person that has to learn stuff the hard way. But now my kids are teenagers and within the past few years I've started reading books again, writing, enjoying music, doing yoga, etc. I feel like me again is what I mean.

We don't realise how much we give up in favor of car infrastructure. Kids' independence (and parents' free time / individuality) is one of the things we give up.

I fear that as my own country gets more and more car dependent, my kids won't be able to enjoy the freedoms I had growing up.

Edit to add: I just remembered that my brother and cousins would ride the bus together to go to their judo lessons starting at age ~6. It was the same bus route every time, they were never alone on the bus because they were 3 kids, my parents would drop them off at one end and my grandparents would pick them up at the other end to take them to the class, but still.

n8901fn,1mnweij,TwoXChromosomes,thebearofwisdom,"Okay I’ve read most of the comments, and yours, and I can’t help but think of the posts about how in laws wanted someone’s house and tried to guilt them into giving it to them. Since she actually doesn’t want to live where you do, I don’t actually believe she wants your house but I do believe she thinks she deserves it more than you, for whatever reason she’s made up in her head. 


My grandmother on my dad’s side is a “fragile” person. Which seems to mean the same as your SIL, she cries at the drop of a hat and everyone attempts to stop that happening by doing whatever she wants to do. I used to believe that if I didn’t, she would literally die of a heart attack. However, through my years of handling her, I realised she’s not going to randomly die because shes upset. She still starts up with me, and I can feel my face go blank and my voice flatten, so she can’t take offence. Except I tend to just talk right over her attempt to cry, and she stops. I don’t actually think that she even does this consciously anymore, she’s just so used to people jumping at the first sign of her choking up, that she does it automatically. 


It does not mean you have to play a role with your SIL, just like I don’t with my grandmother. I also hate confrontation, especially with her cos she’s so emotional, but I find it better to just not acknowledge the tears, or the wobbly voice, or the sniffling. I hate that I have to turn off my emotions to deal with her, I love that woman but she’s kept everyone as a hostage to her tears and I can’t be the one to comfort her anymore. You don’t have to do so either. It’s not your job to make her happy, and it doesn’t sound like she’ll ever be content even though she got what she wanted. 



People like this, sometimes they know that crying gets them things, but sometimes they just think it’s normal to do it because everyone else taught them that. You do not have to aid in that charade, you do not have to deal with her going round in circles. Me and my friends have a thing going where we ask what’s needed, either support and commiseration, or a practical solution. Your SIL doesn’t want the solution because there isn’t one. She wants sympathy, and unfortunately your sympathy well is dry as fuck cos she’s already emptied it long ago. So id ask her outright “what do you want to hear from me? Because the truth is you can’t have what you want, and there’s no solution that will allow you to have both the city and a house like mine. Please tell me what you want here” 

Maybe she’ll tell you, maybe she’ll just cry again, maybe she won’t mention it again. But this lady needs to be told she can’t dump her feelings on you and make your house an uncomfortable environment while she’s in it. Sounds like she shouldn’t visit. My grandparents want to see my house… I refuse to allow it. When I got it, they were nothing but negative about the location despite knowing why I moved and how it’s better for me. My grandmother literally said “I know it’s selfish, I know you’re happy there but I wanted you nearer”

It’s stressful for me that I don’t know what you want from this conversation you bring up every time.

Listen if she has something new or insightful to say. Otherwise ask again if she’s talked with her husband or a therapist about these strong feelings she has about your home.

n8a5axs,1mnweij,TwoXChromosomes,WontTellYouHisName,"All the other answers I see are giving you possible comebacks, but they aren't answering your question, which was what does SHE want you to say.

What she wants is for you to: (1) agree with her about whatever good feature she has mentioned, showing that you approve of her taste and good eye for proper architecture, and (2) describe some downside to the house so that she will feel better about not having it, and (3) you to say you're jealous of her in some symmetric way to build her up and confirm the wisdom of her decision to live where she does.

""It's nice having all this space, but it's got downsides.  Last time I took Amtrak to visit my brother/went to see the local baseball team/school field trip to the science museum/whatever, it was more than an hour getting to the train station/stadium/museum/etc, which I'm sure is just a few minutes for you.""

""It's nice having all this space, but at the same time it means there's a lot to clean, and heat, and cool.  Sometimes I wonder if we really need all of this.""

""The big yard is good to play in, but mowing and seeding and weeding takes forever and costs a lot.  When I lived in an apartment I could play frisbee at the park, which was almost as good but someone else had to do all the lawn care.""

""I like this house, but my friend Anna lives in a rowhouse less than five minutes' walk from the nearest subway stop, and you can't beat that convenience.""

""The house is pretty good, but one of my friends has had trouble with the public schools and is sending her daughter to a private school instead.  We've had a good experience so far, but that kind of thing makes me worry a little.""

Whatever downside you think of, you follow it up with ""It's too bad we can't have everything, isn't it?"" or some similar remark.

And the next time you're at her house, you're supposed to gush about how much you love the decor and if you use the metro to get there, talk about how it must be really great to be five minutes from the metro stop, you can get anywhere without having to drive, or otherwise find some counterpart way in which you are jealous of her.

* ""I KNOW, right?  God I could never live that close to the city if I had to give this place up, *I'm so glad I live in this house instead*.""  (oblivious guilt trip targets are the *worst*).

n8aj89r,1mnweij,TwoXChromosomes,PlatypusStyle,"I thought about it a bit more. Definitely the way to go is some form of grey rocking but how? 

Think of it as similar to training a dog.  Half of dog training is training yourself to do the right thing. You need to be consistent and predictably non-rewarding when she shows this undesired behavior. 

Some ideas:

1. Do not let her physically trap/block you anywhere. You need to be able to quickly walk away at any moment. Just notice your surroundings. If you do find her blocking you use body language, a touch on the shoulder to gently guide her to the side as you make your move. “Oh gosh, I need to check on the roast!“ 

2. Create a list of potential excuses that will help you move away from her. “I need to check on \[blank\]“ or “I need to use the bathroom.” These will be harder to use if you aren’t home but see how many you can come up with. Completely ignore her house comment and just leave. You can come back afterwards but if she starts up again then leave again.

3. If you can’t walk away (e.g., you are in a group at a restaurant or someone else’s home) consider a conversation-starting distractor. “Did you know that the Romans …?” “Has anyone seen that new movie…?” I don’t know what you and your friends are interested in but do some research. Come with a list. New tech is always fascinating. Try New Scientist, Wired, look up Linkfest which has lots of interesting and unusual stuff. please don’t use chatGPT since it will make stuff up!  Again, don’t reward her undesired behavior with the least shred of attention. Everyone in the group will be more interested in talking about this than listening to her.

4. Get your husband to help. Be a team. Brainstorm with him. Have him do some of the subject changing. Can your parents help change the subject too?

It sounds as if she might spend a lot of time ruminating when she’s on her own and because she’s not thinking about other stuff, she ends up having nothing else to talk about when she’s with other people.

Take your time with it, it may take more than one time.  But let her move through all the emotions - don't tell her what to think or feel, but keep asking her why questions, and how she feels about specific parts of this issue.

After that - have a conversation with her about how you feel when she says she is jealous of your home.  Ask her to use a different word than jealous which often has negative connotations towards the person that has what you want.  Suggest different phrases like ""I'm so happy you have this wonderful home, and I wish I could find one like it too"".  In the future if she falls back on ""I'm so jealous...

A grown-ass woman with a husband and kids needs to have more resilience because life is hard.

You're a kind person who is considerate of others, and like a lot of us, are flummoxed by people who are this kind of socially inappropriate. Of course... they've only remained socially inappropriate for *this long* because people like you and me, who try to be nice and polite, have let them be this way. Like, we're empathetic and think, *oh, but I would feel so terrible if someone told me I was being rude and weird and needed to grow up. I'd be humiliated.* And we hate the idea of making someone else feel that way, so.... Your SIL is literally like this because she's exploiting other people's social niceness.

So. Time to take the gloves off.

SIL: [blahblahblahuourhousechokesobblah]

You: Do your kids whine like this all the time, too? Because that's what you're doing and it's effing beyond annoying at this point.

Or,

You: So I've heard. Do you still cry at night because you didn't get a pony as a child? Grow the eff up.

Or,

You: This is why my brother spends as much time away from you as he can, isn't it. You're never effing happy with what you have. You got your way when it came to location of your house, but you've gotta cry because *everything* can't be your way? What the hell are you modeling for your kids? Be an adult and get over it.

My point is, giving your coworkers a heads up—if you’re able to—is always the way to go. When the company I work for held an impromptu meeting to let us know they were getting rid of all team leads and supervisors across the company, the first thing I did was text my team lead and give her a heads up. Her meeting was later that day and none of us knew what any of them were about at first, so since we’d been they let anyone go, there was no way in hell I was going to let her walk in blind. 

I know a couple hours may not have made much of a difference, but I hope it at least gave her some time to prepare herself for the blow. These big corps don’t care about a single one of us, they only care about making more and more money for as little cost as possible, so we have to stick together and look out for one another where we can. 

I’ve said all this to say that I’m so glad you gave your friend a warning before it happened. I really think we as the working class need to work on worker solidarity, because the people up top only get away with treating us like shit because we allow them to.

In my role I was the ‘junior’ at seven years. This was not a company with a high turnover. A lot of people were on union contracts that had very strict ‘last in, first out’ rules. I was quite a good friend to the person who was my 2-up manager at the time, we had become friends prior to them ending up in that role. 

I think we were told of the redundancies on a Monday morning. He had known all weekend and didn’t look like he had slept the entire time. About 1/2 of my team were laid off, including the team lead - who walked out without telling us what was going on, she just took her handbag, said I’m going for an early lunch, and didn’t come back. 

I’m not mad at him for not telling me in advance. It was utterly outside of his control that it happened. He helped me references and referrals to get a new job, and was my main referee for years. Unfortunately he passed from cancer during covid, while based in another country.

I would also advise that you have a discussion with her about the actual realities of pregnancy and having a child. The majority of people, especially at her age, have only been exposed to the very idealized versions of those things. Having a baby sounds similar to getting a puppy, in that there is no thought put into the years of caring for it you'll have to do. It is often just seen as a box to check or a cute thing to have, with people thinking that they will ""just know"" what to do. Explain to her that having a kid is the most permanent thing you can do. While you can change the color of your hair, move to a new country, and even get divorced, you can not un-have a kid. And once you have one, they're what your life has to revolve around. It doesn't matter if you're tired, or sick, or poor. You still have to support them, teach them, and do most everything for them. 

Lots of girls in my class who got pregnant in their teens did not have a conversation like that.

I used to wake up and basically roll into the car and head to work, no breakfast, no shower, no packed lunch, no nothing. In minutes. Sometimes I would even brush my teeth at work before I opened the store. I would run on fumes for hours. But then I had some good role models at a job in my early 20s. They came into work relaxed and happy, not flustered and cranky and hungry. I wanted what they were having. Turns out, they woke up super early and made themselves a leisurely breakfast and enjoyed themselves as if it were a morning off.

My biggest game changer is setting everything up the night before. I make lunch, set out my clothes, and shower before bed. 


I start work at 6am, first alarm goes off at 440am, out of bed by 5am. I use the bathroom, then start water boiling. I get dressed while water boils and am done by the whistle. I make tea, breakfast toast, and coffee for the road. Take meds and gather everything I need for the day by the door (everything is pretty much ready to go the night before). Then I brush my teeth and put my hair up, and it's out the door by 545am. 


My commute is 10 min, so I leave the house 15 min before work starts. A trick that helped me is I set all my clocks forward the amount of my commute (15min) so when my clocks read 'work start time' (6am), I need to be out the door. 


I'm guessing you have some non- essential activities in your mornings that could get simplified or pared way down.


Setting up the night before to *eliminate morning decision making* is huge.  Decisions are super time consuming for morning brain. Think about how this time all adds up in your life. That's a LOT of unpaid labor you're doing for work. It's a sizeable chunk of your life. Spend that time doing things that truly improve your quality of life. ",1,2025-08-12 18:21:12,False,Getting ready for work?,40,2025-08-12 04:56:01,100,,,,,,[]

There are whole groups on telegram where users share what exactly prompts they have used to get the AI apps to create not just pictures but short video porn clips as well. As soon as one app changes their guardrails, they move on to another app and find out the prompts to get it to do it. There are also many that will do this with pictures of minors as well. There was even an article they did about how 1 in 10 minors say their friends use the apps to make nudes of other students. 

On the one hand, it feels like everyone is gonna have nudes out there, whether real nudes or fake nudes and so the hope is that it won't be a big issue anymore for a career if a nude comes out. You just say it wasn't you.

Videogame streamer Sweet Anita (deals with topics such as women's issues, her Tourette Syndrome and more) made a video on this. People had made nude images of her with AI which somehow looked so real that she said it looked like her actual body. Apparently AI is smart enough to know what you look like under your clothes by calculating the shape and volume of your body and breasts.

AI hosts are rapidly running damage control as they now too see the problem with this, but not all services play nice and some care only about money.

Within the next three years expect that bothersome neighbor to be able to use a photo he snuck of you in the backyard in bikini and a nude of himself in the mirror to create realistic pornography of you two which only an expert can tell apart. Now imagine that in the hands of high school bullies who took a photo of your child during gym class. You can see the problem probably.

Unless extensive, specified laws are created worldwide (and enforced!) there'll be little we can do. The authorities are ill informed and don't take the issue serious thus far. Remember how long it took before internet bullying and threats were taken serious? Decades!

It will match skin tone, and maybe approximate body shape, and then the rest is just going to be a best estimate based on what’s in the training data. It takes an estimate of what other women that vaguely resemble you look like, with a strong bias towards the porn actresses and nude models that make up a huge portion of the nude body datasets it’s trained on. So if you’re skinny IRL, then it will guesstimate a skinny nude body, but it will have no idea what the details look like. The more skin you’re showing in the starting picture, the more overall accurate it will be of course, so if you’re in a bikini it’s going to look a lot closer to reality than if you’re in every day clothes etc.

n8fihmj,1mo3xwu,TwoXChromosomes,goldfishinspace,"Hey, you do you! I was just trying to share that there’s no research to support it. 

“Lisa Dawn Hamilton, PhD, a psychology professor and sex researcher, points out that “There is very little research on the topic at all, but the existing studies have shown no link. In fact, when comparing people with and without UTIs, the studies find that equal numbers of people pee and don’t pee after sex in the UTI and non-UTI groups.”

Given the low-impact nature of an intervention like urinating after intercourse, many researchers, doctors, and concerned parents continue to advise doing so.

n8cgfkk,1mnze9z,TwoXChromosomes,CandyCoatedDinosaurs,"The package of pills is small. Credit card sized. If you have parents who respect your privacy even a little, you could easily hide it in a wallet or coin purse or back zipper pocket of your purse. If you have parents who actively search your belongings... good luck.

The harder thing to hide will be actually taking them. You need to take them at the same time each day, and it is easy to forget if you don't have some sort of alarm or hard-set routine.

For one, girsl always berfomered better than boys across several countries. So this isnt a new phenomonon to begin with. 

>The study reveals that recent claims of a “boy crisis,” with boys lagging behind girls in school achievement, are not accurate because girls’ grades have been consistently higher than boys’ across several decades with no significant changes in recent years, the authors wrote. 

https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2014/04/girls-grades

Also it is largly cultural, meaning being good in school is just seen as ""uncool"" for young boys in western countries.

>But there’s an exception. Asian-American boys match the grades of Asian-American girls in elementary school, a new study has found. For them, the gender achievement gap doesn’t appear until adolescence — at which point they start doing worse as a group than Asian-American girls.
The study adds to a growing body of research suggesting that boys’ underperformance is not because of anything innate to boys. Instead, it seems, it’s largely because of something external: their school environments and peer influences.

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/upshot/the-gender-achievement-gap-starts-later-for-asian-american-students.html

>The study, published recently in the journal Early Childhood Research Quarterly, was led by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh who conducted assessments of 814 children in the United States, China, and South Korea.
In the United States, the study found that girls had higher levels of self-regulation than boys. In China, South Korea, and Taiwan, the study found no gender gap when researchers directly assessed the self-regulation of 3-to-6-year-olds. Self-regulation is defined as children’s ability to control their behavior and impulses, follow directions, and persist in completing a task.

>The Pew Research Center has found that boys are more likely to think they don’t need a degree for the jobs they want

>Among adults, men are more likely than women to cite factors that reflect personal choices to not attend college or complete their degrees.

A kid wants to be ""more manly"" so he joins a couple of sites about working out.  He figures if he gets into shape, he'll get a girlfriend or three.  He gets a couple of Workout Bro podcast recommendations.  The Workout Bros kinda of bag on women, but hey, that's just locker room talk and these guys are handsome and successful and have girls hanging all over them, so they must know things he doesn't.  They recommended some other BroCasts, which are definitely more edgy, but if you don't like them, it's because you're a pussy with no sense of humor.  Well, he's a Real Man so he laughs along and, yeah, they're actually kind of funny.

In real life, he's not achieving much success.  Why?  He gets told in forums that it's not him, it's women.  He's a great guy.  Women would be throwing themselves at his feet, begging to be his girlfriend if only feminism hadn't gotten to them first.  He starts listening to more BroCasts to learn about how terrible feminism is.  It's even worse than he'd imagined.  Feminists are throwing themselves at Low Value Men (LVM), especially Black ones, instead of High Value Men (HVM) like him.  And those LVM are working their way through all the women, reducing their value so he'll never get the kind of woman he deserves.

After that, he's listening to podcasts and participating in forums about how to get the High Value Women (HVW) he deserves.  He may end up going the Andrew Tate direction - buy Tate's courses and hustle enough and you'll get all the bang-stock you want.  He may go the White Supremacist direction - must protect all the endangered HVW (the ones with ""great jeans"").  He may mix-and-match those ""values.""

Needless to say, he's not a slightly shy but nice kid any more.  

**This doesn't excuse the kid in the least.**  It's just an explanation of why this is happening far more frequently than it used to.  Understanding how it happens can lead to ways to innoculate boys from getting mixed up in this to begin with, ways to deprogram them, and hopefully ways to shut down the Alt-Right pipeline before the next generation is damaged.

n85o50q,1mn9j99,TwoXChromosomes,EmmaInFrance,"It's a small world!

I stayed at Ogmore camp a few times :-)

And of course, I know that area very well. We had a family friend who worked on the restoration of the walled gardens at Southerndown, back in the day, and they were always one of my favourite places.

Now, I just re-watch episodes of Doctor Who to see the beach and get homesick, as I've been living in Brittany for over 20 yrs.

We also used to go to Merthyr Mawr dunes, as kids, and sledge down the dunes!

My kids are all AuDHD too, and my Mum most likely is too.

My brother was diagnosed with dyslexia as a kid, in the late 70s, which my mum really had to fight for as Mid Glam LEA didn't even recognise that it existed back then. I think that she had to go to Cardiff? 

He's now on the waiting list for an autism diagnosis, and he most likely also has ADHD too, but as he's still in the Bridgend area, it could be years...

---

The multi-generational inherited neurodivergence thing is a massive barrier to diagnosis, especially if you're AFAB due to  our 'quieter'° presentations of both autism and ADHD, and often further complicated by a lack if understanding of how AuDHD presents, and/or how PDA affects the presentation of autism, and it's hugely underestimated by the 'autism establishment'.

°summarising a much more complex subject with just one word!

When you have multiple generations in a family who all behaved the same way as children, especially the mums, how are they supposed to spot the signs of atypical early childhood behaviour, or even later childhood or teenage behaviour?

When my mum and I were completing the early childhood questionnaires, as part of my autism assessment, for so many questions, when the answer was obviously pointing to atypical, autistic behaviour - say, lining up toys - she'd reply, over and over:

""But that's normal, I did that too when I was a kid.""

Even before I was formally assessed, just telling her why I was seeking an assessment, I had to tell her that:

""Mum, neurotypical kids don't spend their primary school lunch breaks under a hazel bush, in the hedge, every day, pretending it's a shop, and turning hazel leaves into hats for fairies!""

""Mum, neurotypical kids don't spend the entire school break time in the stairwell, spinning with their arms out, when they're nearly 13!""

She got fed up of me talking about it all the time back then, but to be fair, it was all I did talk about because it was such a massive thing for me.

But she also went off and did her own reading. She has some friends who are knowledgeable, with ND kids, one wh's actually autistic, and one who used to work in UK schools helping with diagnosis and is highly qualified - I've met her and she's great.

Since then, she's even been happy to read my copy of Untypical by Peter Wharmby and she found it really helpful.

It's taken time, but she's come a long, long way.",3,2025-08-11 11:48:53,False,Men get every excuse - even for murder or joining neo Nazi groups (rant),1615,2025-08-11 03:40:32,143,,,,,,[]

I live in Port Talbot now, not really my thing as such. Nowhere near as nature heavy as back home, I spent a lot of time living in Southern Eryri (Snowdonia) as well as Ceredigion so I'm used to trees everywhere, green fields and the sea. I used to sledge down the sand dunes of Ynyslas (a small village just north of Aberystwyth) as a kid all the time myself!

I used to play WoW with someone from Brittany, it's cool seeing how similar our languages are, so I can see why as a Welsh person you'd move there. 

I'm unsure if I have ADHD myself. My Mom says I do, and my brothers and possibly sister has it, but it wasn't diagnosed in me. I had to go to Cardiff in the late '90s for diagnosis myself...a bit nuts as there was 20 years between your brother's diagnosis and mine but Ceredigion as a county was very backward. 

Ugh, knowing how the local area is I can see it being years still, everything around here just happens so slowly! I hope it happens soon for him though.

From what I know of my own autism it presents more like the female kind. I have very rarely had meltdowns, but am incredibly shy, just spent my time collecting things and to be honest I used to play in the bushes at my primary school with my friend too!

However, I never went to their house again and kept as far away from him as possible, which affected my friendship with his wife and we lost touch. I much later found out that he'd done the same to other mutual female friends, and they too distanced from the friendship as a result. 


This woman lost many female friends because of her drunk husbands behaviour. Don't let this be you OP. You're going to need these friends when this behaviour escalates and you want to get out.


Side note, I later also found out that the men in our friendship circle knew about this guys behaviour, and laughed it off as ""haha yeah Steve always got a bit handsy when drunk"" and did nothing to protect us or warn us. In fact my closest male friend at the time, left me at Steve's house because he was too tired to drive me home like he'd promised.

n81qlpa,1mmvk0m,TwoXChromosomes,SereneDelacroix,"You don’t accidentally sexual assault a friend, let alone two in one night, drunk or not. He took his shot before you guys moved and probably assumed they wouldn’t tell you, or you wouldn’t find out until you moved across the county and were more vulnerable or unable to leave him. This was very intentional. DO NOT MOVE WITH THIS MAN. I dont know your work or financial situation, but at the very least you will be losing your friends/family/support system to be isolated with a man that is capable of sexual assault, cheating etc etc. 

It’s very easy to use alcohol as an excuse, and clearly he is doing that by pretending to make some big gesture by ‘giving up alcohol’ in response. Alcohol doesn’t make normal men rape or sexually assault women. It just provides a convenient excuse for men that are already capable of such terrible things.

I can see you are also trying to excuse some of this by saying it was ‘not intended as a come-on’ but him just ‘being friendly’. Because he’s a friendly guy right? Sweetie. He tried to kiss one and rubbed the others private area. That is not ‘friendly’. I know you might tell yourself well, the back rub was just a friendly offer, or the offer to come chill with him was just a friendly offer etc- NO. None of that is friendly. He suggested those things to try to escalate to more contact, like the kissing and sexual touches and more. Good guys don’t do this stuff out of the blue, even when drunk. 

What if your friend didn’t pretend to fall asleep and he’d done more? Or what if they were so inebriated they couldn’t say no? Or what if they decided they did want to sleep with your husband and went for it? The only reason more didn’t happen is because your friends weren’t interested and found ways to get him to leave. He. Would. Have. Done. More. 

Would you blame the alcohol still?  I know it’s hard, but there is no excuse here. Are you ever going to be able to trust him around your female friends again? Are you going to be able to sleep next to him in bed every night knowing he’s capable of those type of things? Or are you always going to wonder now?

_The reality is that alcohol does not, in any case, ever cause someone to sexually assault or rape- the 
proof, of course, is that then most everyone, if not everyone who

Tw: attempted sa 

I'm here as a bloke because I had a best mate for years who ""out of the blue"" tried to rape a woman I dated at the time whilst she stayed at his home with his partner with brain cancer.
I was travelling and staying overnight at the other end of the state for an important job interview, and she wished to stay with our mates and have a catch up and a few beers seeing as I'd be away for a night. All good, sweet plan. 

I find out the next day that he was so drunk and up late that he was tapping on her window from the outside during his drunken wobbling about alone whilst his fiance was in bed,
Then wandered into the spare room, took his clothes off and tried to get ontop of her, she's half his size, the managed to boot him off because he was so wasted, thank fuck.

So he got dragged out to the common area, woke his fiance and he got questioned like you imagine anyone having had this shocking thing happen would do.

*he eventually admitted to watching her at times when we visited before, and he felt wrong having sex with his partner with cancer* - you know that's honest because it's pathetic.

The next morning he's all suicidal and his mother is involved and he's quitting drinking etc etc. But really they forced him to. I found out mid next morning and I drove all the way home for hours not knowing which way was up. I was going to go to his place and confront him, but I had someone at home who was literally suffering shock, so I chose to go. Straight home obviously.

I kicked him instantly out of my life, best mate of 6 years, who had shown no signs of this before, only he did drink a lot. Called my mates in tears to let them know, because they'd all feel sick if they were chummy and didn't know what he had done, so they also ditched this asshole too. 

His parter did keep contact and I gave her some support as she reached out and didn't have much. It was horrible for her too.
She stayed with him, told me later that he kept asking and getting upset when she said he wasn't allowed to go have beers with his brother because of drinking ban, this was the condition of her staying.

So yeah, this bloke was all very sorry, all the I'm the worst I should kill myself etc etc, few months later he's whining that he can't get drunk again.

I think this man in OPs instance probably needs another pass with the questions... Because there's an issue there and alcohol isn't all that's going on. I've been wasted before and never thought I'll just do something to someone because they look nice.

I woke up to him saying my name, spooning me from behind, and slowly moving closer, trying to put his hand under my waistband.

I moved away and he didn’t push it further. The next day I told my friend what happened. She believed me, but after a talk with the boyfriend she bought his story about being too drunk and that he did weird things like blacking out and peeing in a corner. He told her he thought I was her.

He was lying. He was saying my name and slowly, deliberately trying to touch me. There’s no way he didn’t offer to stay with me because I was drunk and vulnerable.

...do. not. fall. for. sorry.

He might even mean it. It doesn't change *anything* and here is why:

- The first time they commit the crime is not the first time they thought of committing it.

- Booze doesn't make you into a predator, booze lowers inhibition

- You are *not* safe around him.

- Quitting booze goes without saying. But as a few stories in the comments will tell you... see how long it takes him to try and loosen the rules about this again.

- Not a single female friend of yours should ever be brought around him without a disclaimer and a warning. Not. One. Do you want to have that conversation every single time for the rest of your life? Because not having it would be taking his side. And having it will consistently label him an undesirable. The inbetween would be lying by ommission - and it's not your or your husband's choice whether he's safe enough for the women in your life. It's theirs. You know in your heart you'd be uneasy hanging with your friend's husband if the roles were reversed - please do not forget how important the validity of this is.



Your husband needs therapy asap. So do you. It should not be couples' counselling until further notice, but individual therapy.

*You* need to come to terms with *your* feelings about this. He cannot be a part of this. As much as it sucks to be him right now... it sucks so much more to be your friends and you.


""Sorry"" cannot fix this. Neither can promises. I am so sorry but it's true.

n84dqsx,1mmvk0m,TwoXChromosomes,MyTootsMyTootsMyToot,"This happened to me. A dear friend started dating a guy in our friend group. She moved across the country with him, and a year later they bought a house closer to our hometown. I was psyched because I loved her, and her boyfriend and I had a good friendship too. A different girlfriend and I went to visit them for an overnighter. My two friends tapped out early that night, but I stayed up talking with the bf about an author we both admired who was releasing new books. Like I genuinely was so excited to talk to another person who was into this very niche writer and never once considered maybe I shouldn’t be alone with this guy. 

I’ll skip the ugly bits just to say that I also assumed I was safe because my friends—his girlfriend!—were in the master bedroom not ten feet from the living room we had been chatting in. I guess he was counting on my fear response to freeze rather than fight, which he accurately predicted. He also claimed no memory of the incident and swore off alcohol “for good” (read: 3 months). And like other commenters have said, I saw a lot of red flags in hindsight that I had glossed over prior to this. 

I ended up telling my girls the moment they woke up (he was passed out drunk still). It was awkward and awful, and I ultimately ended up losing my friendship with this girl. I don’t blame her though. She’d put all her eggs in their shared basket. They bought a home together, had combined finances, and she basically had no local friends or support system. To leave him would have been a complete disruption of her life and security. She had to do what she needed to, and I can’t hold that against her. 

OP, you have to take care of you, and it sounds like you have a lot of logistical things in the air with your pending move, but know this: I would have done quite literally anything I could to support my friend had she decided to leave this predator. Stuff can be replaced, finances can be restored, and a genuine love is out in the world waiting for you to be ready for it.

n81oe1v,1mmvk0m,TwoXChromosomes,ExecManagerAntifaCLE,"What would you want to do if you didn't have the move putting timeline pressure on you?

I think my biggest question would be ""is this genuinely a single bad night, or is it a pattern""? I think you'll know fairly soon if it wasn't - when it gets around what happened (and specifically, that you had your friends' backs when they spoke up), anyone who had a previous experience with him that minimized it or decided not to mention it at the time might decide to speak up now.

There are guys who use a facade of ""one of the good ones"" to provide opportunity or cover for their sexual violence. Someone in that category doesn't go to all that trouble for one night - they set up opportunities over and over again.

Someone who is actually a generally good person who did something they're horrified by while drunk? Deciding to avoid drinking (and following through) is a good start. I've known folks who approached accountability for a sexual violation within a community, and another basic starting point I'd suggest is that it's his responsibility to leave quietly if there's a social situation where the victims are present (including if they show up to something he's already at). 

How seriously he takes what he did will tell you a lot. (And you don't *have* to give him a chance here.)

Edit: after re-reading the chronology I don't buy that it's not a pattern. Sure, alcohol can convince you that people are more into you than they actually are, and create opportunities for some terrible judgement. But ""blackout drunk while rubbing a friend's crotch"" followed by strictly friendly coherent texts to a second friend to initiate a backrub followed by trying to get in her pants?

This is one of the many injuries of infidelity- the feeling of having been fooled, the feeling of “did I ever really know him/her at all?” and after that, “what else might I have been wrong about?”

I guess it’s up to you if you will consider his attempt at sex and supremely creepy actions on your friends to be infidelity. It’s dishonest and dehumanizing to your friends at the least.

n81h1df,1mmvk0m,TwoXChromosomes,Usual-Ad-6888,"I’m not going to lie, I did the same thing once (I’m a girl, in case that matters). I got so drunk everybody thought I had alcohol poisoning and I groped a FWB of mine. I genuinely don’t remember anything from that night past 9pm and this happened sometime much later. I’ve never been that drunk before or since, and I’ve never done anything like that again. It’s a shame I carry with me every day, even though we made amends and are still best friends several years later. The real difference between his situation and mine is that I had a pre-existing sexual relationship with that person, and your husband does not, not to mention that he’s not exactly single.

My point is, it’s plausible that he genuinely doesn’t remember doing this if he were truly blackout drunk. Either way, this definitely counts as cheating (and obviously SA). He had to have some sort of attraction or want to touch those people in that way. It’s your choice if you want to make amends with him. I feel his response and whether he’s putting himself in a position to reoffend is what’s most important in determining his character moving forward. He can never undo what he did, but he can always do better.

Even though he wouldn't show this side, and supposedly 'doesn't remember' (how convenient), intoxication normally lowers your inhibitions, and what you are inside is shown.  
It may seem 'out of character', but that's what SAs and pedos are like - they never show 'that side' to anyone except their victim.  
There are plenty of 'safe' and 'nice' guys, but a lot of them are sexual predators building trust over long periods of time for their 'image' of nice and safe.. until they think it's safe. I say this from experience.

If he blacks out and didn’t think much concern of that, it’s not a new thing. .2 BAC (blood alcohol) essentially turns people into zombies.

At .2 or higher brain is only functional for unconscious bodily processes & very base instincts/impulses. There is no longer an ability to think, feel, or make choices. behavior is similar to wild animals. it is our developed brains that makes us humans. Bc it gives us the ability to make decisions,  reason, make choices, hold beliefs, understand right v wrong, and curb base instincts for higher order thinking/behavior. 

At blackout level and higher people are literally just bodies reacting. Not good.

There are guys who use a facade of ""one of the good ones"" to provide opportunity or cover for their sexual violence. Someone in that category doesn't go to all that trouble for one night - they set up opportunities over and over again.

Someone who is actually a generally good person who did something they're horrified by while drunk? Deciding to avoid drinking (and following through) is a good start.

One night he was too drunk to drive and I was not, so I drove him back to my house to sleep it off - with us both on the same page that absolutely nothing sexual was happening, this was just me helping a drunk friend by letting him crash on my couch. 

Woke up to him in bed next to me, naked, with him fumbling to use my hand to jack himself off. I pretended to stir, rolled over, and ""went back to sleep"". I stayed awake all night, terrified, because I'm a fucking fawn/freezer with too much past trauma (that he also knew about btw, sick fuck). He fell asleep, snored, and then slunk away in the morning.

Sometimes not to *this* degree, but typically working towards some sort of payoff, whether they're in relationships or not. OP was likely blind to it and thats not to her fault, they were probably all blind to it because to them it was a breath of fresh air. Finally, a ""nice guy"" thats IN a relationship and it's with our friend. Surely he only has eyes for her. However, deep down he was likely aware of that sentiment and took advantage of it. He figured *some day* if he keeps working on those trust points, he'll get his chance to pounce. What better chance than the moment before moving far away? He always had this in his head.

n89uyuq,1mmvk0m,TwoXChromosomes,happywatermelon59,"I guess this is an unpopular opinion but I actually think if he gives up alcohol permanently forever it's a green flag.  

I had a good friend who made an inappropriate and handsy sexual joke at my expense when he was drunk.  It made me (and the one bystander) very uncomfortable.  He didn't remember it, was surprised it happened, and said he didn't even think things like that normally.  He also got into some fights and destroyed some furniture that same night and we roommates had an intervention for him the next day.  He seemed contritious. He was a good friend to me many times before that and after that, and I decided to forgive for that.

Obviously this situation is different, but I decided to believe him when he said he doesn't normally even think things like that.  That's why if your husband has decided to give up alcohol, I think it might be legit. 

Of course, you and him should still face any consequences of this that could happen, and the only thing giving me pause is that you're imminently moving across the country with him.  That is a bit risky on the chance he's lying and everyone else here is right about his actions and motivations.  I would also NEVER allow him to have alcohol after this, and if he tries to go back on it, then he's not really taking it seriously enough / maybe it was him and not the alcohol after all.  So, the cross country move is risky because you don't have enough data of his actions after this event.

It's also completely justified if you want to bail on him after this, even if you DID believe him that it was the alcohol.

n81rbvg,1mmvk0m,TwoXChromosomes,Sarsmi,"The only things that I've done behavior-wise that I regretted while on alcohol were saying things that I had been thinking or venting frustrations that I had been feeling. But I've never wanted to get handsy or hook up with someone who didn't want me, mainly because a big part of my attraction to someone else is that they feel attraction to me as well. I think most normal people, if they find someone attractive and things start going on, if they realize that the other person isn't into them, it should kill the attraction. I don't get how it could be fun to fool around with someone who is passive/disinterested. And it would be downright horrible to be in the midst of something sexual and then realize that they actively do not like what is happening. And yet, there are people who really just care about getting off regardless of how the other person feels, which blows my mind.  

I think it's difficult to understand that mindset if you don't feel that way, but once you think about it and try to put yourself in that position, you realize that only a monster could take advantage of an unwilling participant. There isn't enough alcohol in the world for someone who finds the idea of such a thing abhorrent that they could ever embrace it.

n8caot1,1mmvk0m,TwoXChromosomes,grazzlegritch,"I agree, I don't think he was nearly as drunk as one would need to be to truly not remember or being somewhat in control of their actions. I've been the woman who was touched in a situation like this and have seen it happen to others. Obviously, it's never okay, but in situations that WERE forgivable, the people who assaulted someone (either myself or someone else) were completely black out drunk, extremely remorseful (not just remorseful they got caught) and one even tried to break up with their partner because they felt so sick with themselves. And when I say black out I mean seriously blacked out - like passed out within 20 minutes of the incident for 10+ hours with alcohol poisoning, could not function, let alone send a coherent text (or even an incoherent one for that matter). In the situations where I've had drunk men touch me inappropriately, I could always tell if they were actually aware (drunk aware I suppose) and shooting their shot or were actually black out drunk and didnt seem aware of what they were doing. I would say my friends who've had it happen to them can also tell. 

I've been on the receiving end of what was intentional sexual assault being masked as drunkness, and it was fairly obvious when looking back at it or past behaviours.

The fact that your friends came to you and didn't say they thought it was an honest mistake is telling (not to mention the convenient timing). When a family members husband (who didnt often drink and got black out due to a poor mix of not eating, heat and being on a new medication they didn't take the 'no drinking' warning seriously) I still told her what happened, but I did tell her that I genuinely thought it was a mistake and he had never done anything to make me or any other woman in our life uncomfortable prior to that incident. Obviously, it was up to her at that point to decide if she could accept that or not. 

If you're planning to stay with him and your friends didn't voice anything along those lines, I would assume they did feel like it was purposeful or they saw signs of that behavior in him before. If they were comfortable enough to come to you, they would likely be comfortable enough to tell you if they thought it was an honest ""mistake"" or something more calculated/purposeful.",3,2025-08-12 12:25:13,False,Husband SA'ed two friends and I don't know what to do next,4185,2025-08-10 15:04:37,752,,,,,,[]

While I’m not 100% sure that he DIDN’T do it on purpose. I do think people are oversimplifying the effects of alcohol. 

It not only affects your memory, and impulsivity it impairs judgment. It causes emotional dysregulation. The idea that “whatever a person does drunk is what they want to do sober” is way too black and white. Behavior isn’t that simple.

I used to work behavioral health with addiction- and I think these comments may be oversimplifying the actual cognitive losses and impairments while drunk. 

In my opinion- If alcohol is capable of causing things like Korsakoff’s Dementia, then it can cause behaviors that aren’t meant, and forgetting them. 

I’d be interested what a biochemist/neurologist/neuropsychologist would say.

n80ydwn,1mmvk0m,TwoXChromosomes,annagarg,"Wait, basic_bitch. I also used to drink to a point everyone had stories of - “you know what you did last night?” and I used to get hyper sexual as well. I would write very explicit texts and would take higher sexual risks than when I was sober. I have woken up in beds not knowing how and when I got there. 

But the patterns have always matched my sober patterns.

Explicit texts and waking up in bed of - were always with people whom I was already seeing in some capacity. I am obviously filtering out SAs where someone sober drugged me and I was the victim. Am talking about where I was too drunk but upright and animated and memories coming to me next day and people surprised that I didn’t remember because of how conscious I seemed (like getting on top of them!). Also, when I was like that, I could not hide it from people around. And there were always other signs as well, which I wasn’t aware of but an onlooker would know - oh she is drunk AF.

What is different here is that OP’s partner was able to do stuff while being in the blanket with people around. That level of discreet is not drunk. It is also weird that he didn’t seem to have made advances to OP, if he was drunk and horny, he would have approached his partner. The second instance where he went to the staying over friend, rubbed her back and tried to kiss her and then left - oh my goodness, not something a drunk out of wits person does. These are more predatory than drunk. The only way this could be a drunk person’s behaviour would be if they were creepy when sober as well - something OP would have noticed.

n87hrdv,1mmvk0m,TwoXChromosomes,motherofsuccs,"I work in behavioral therapy and continuing my education in neuroscience. My opinion is a mix of experience and knowledge. 

Everyone’s brain responds a bit differently to alcohol. Just because you get drunk and repeat stories doesn’t mean others don’t get into serious shit. Look at how many fights, crimes, bad choices are made solely due to alcohol. Some people get blackout drunk, puke, and pass out; others become functioning blackout drunk and continue on for hours, with little to no memory of events that happened. It’s like your brain is anesthetized but your body is on autopilot. It’s far from rare. **It’s in no way an “absurd” excuse.**

My point is that this man is most likely telling the truth. His reaction is proving that. He’s taken responsibility for his actions and sounds mortified at what he did. He’s vowing to give up alcohol to prevent it ever happening again. If he was aware of what he did and it was intentional, he’d most likely try to hide it and become defensive. 

Alcohol 100% makes people act in a way they NEVER would while sober and thinking clearly. It has nothing to do with a “real” personality/wants/thoughts being exposed due to inhibition- we’ve already proven that over and over again with multiple studies. It’s an outdated and incorrect take. 

I think you’re being very judgmental and accusatory of someone you don’t know. You’re taking your *personal experiences* and naively assuming every other human MUST have identical experiences, while ignoring the ungodly amount of factors at play. This man has no history of behaving like this with anyone and he’s well-trusted among his peers.

The fact you’re at this point means you two are not compatible. And if you’re not compatible you shouldn’t be together. Maybe you sometimes on occasion become “close” to compatible….. that’s still incompatible. Compatibility is something your relationship either has or doesn’t have. 

There’s lots of reasons you’re probably not compatible that don’t translate to him being a bad guy. You probably have moments where you think “I can make this work” but that’s just the him not being an awful person talking. 

You can be incompatible with great people that give you a lot of benefits…… it doesn’t matter…. If you’re incompatible you’re incompatible.

n827c8q,1mn2dtw,TwoXChromosomes,NeoSailorMoon,"I noticed that when I stabilized emotionally, my libido was also stable and didn’t require me to flicky nearly as much anymore.

I made the connection that there are two distinct reasons when I have a high libido:

1.	⁠There is a man in my life my body wants me to mate with. This is the fun version of libido that doesn’t feel like a chore.
2.	⁠I’m emotionally dysregulated, depressed, stressed, anxious, and so unhappy that my body is desperate to boost my serotonin and dopamine levels via wanking. Boooo, we hate this one.

So my advice is get emotionally stable (assuming you aren’t) and you’ll naturally desire fapping less. That doesn’t solve the problem of masturbation, but it does help reduce the sessions.

If it's dorms, get a room divider and tell your roomie to put their ear buds in already.

>all i got are these bad boys ✋️✋️

That's two left hands, there's the problem. Jokes aside:

First, poses. Propping yourself up, laying on your side, legs drawn up or stretched, find what's easiest for you. For me a mirror sometimes helps, I don't know why and if this is just me, me being bi or if it's a universal thing for us all. Some friends do, some don't.

When I don't have the luxury of a toy at hand, I find things that arouse me and fantasize about those (head smut) or I'll find and read something with that same theme on my phone (read smut). It's enough to get me in the right mindset to masturbate. No porn or visual material required.

If having toys for whatever reason is a no-no, find sanitary or self-care products that are conveniently phallic shaped and make do with those. I think plenty of generations made do with a small hairspray bottle or hairbrush handle and some oil before owning a vibrator or dildo.

Also, try r/TwoXSex which is the sister channel aimed at sexual advice, more so than this channel probably.

n866bmk,1mnf2sh,TwoXChromosomes,fluffystarbuck,"I’m working on being a people pleaser myself, but my boyfriend told me something the other day after I had a bad day that helped to shift my perspective.

It can be a tough pill to swallow, but basically what he told me was that on a day to day, minute to minute basis, most people aren’t thinking about you. Even if you do screw up at work or have an awkward interaction, most people aren’t even thinking about it for more than five minutes. The second they leave the building/you leave they’re thinking about their families, their lives, chores, work, etc. 

To that end, despite being a doormat/being a yes man/sacrificing for others/etc, most people don’t really even “like” you. They tolerate you- not in a negative way, but in a neutral way. You’re just there. 

They may like what you *do* for them every once in a while, but in the end of the day, you shouldn’t feel a need to worry about pleasing people who “tolerate” you in that sense.

That doesn’t mean you should burn the world down or change who you are- just that you shouldn’t put so much angst into being “tolerated”. 

It’s better to put that energy into the relationships and people you care about, which includes yourself.",8,2025-08-11 13:20:50,False,My entire life is spent trying to please everyone,103,2025-08-11 07:50:49,22,,,,,,[]

n82nmjy,1mmyzcc,TwoXChromosomes,enkelvla,"Since OP hasn’t responded; I use a thermarest neoair xlite pad (the larger square version) when hiking and so far I’m really happy with it. My dad and boyfriend have slept on it too and I haven’t heard any complaints. It’s on the more expensive side but that’s mostly because I also needed warmth and light weight for longer hiking trips in the north. Most of the gear I bought I went to a physical store for to get recommendations and I’m honestly pretty satisfied with all of it. I would recommend choosing a local shop over a big chain store though and deciding on a budget beforehand. Often the salespeople there will be really geeky about gear and committed to helping you find just what you need instead of just making a profit. 


I personally splurged on the sleeping pad, sleeping bag (because of aforementioned northern climate) and good hiking shoes. Everything else is not as important for a beginner and can be upgraded later.",8,2025-08-11 00:27:25,False,I love my husband,1111,2025-08-10 17:39:16,64,,,,,,[]
