This begs the question, how did we loose sight of men and boys a human beings, entitled to the same rights and protections as women and girls? 

Sadly, the answer is that men and boys have never been considered as equal beneficiaries of human rights, compared to women and girls. Our social fabric has depended on the repeated callous disregard for men and boys as free individuals, and their enlistment as disposable pawns to be sacrificed for the benefit of others. 

This may be why the benificance of masculinity is so frequently described in terms of the benefits or harms it provides to the community in general, and in particular, to women and girls.

🚨🚨 To Everyone Affected by AWDTSG or Safe Tea: Here’s How to Fight Back 🚨🚨 If you've already sent an email—send it again. If you haven’t, now is the time

We’re done playing this insane game. These apps are doing real harm. The fastest way to shut them down is **cutting off their payment processors**.

---

### 🧨 The Harm These Apps Cause:

* **Defamation & Harassment**: AWDTSG (6M users) and Safe Tea (\$1.6M ARR) allow people to post **anonymous, unverified information** that ruins lives—careers shattered, mental health devastated, stalkers enabled.

* **Privacy Violations**: These apps **track sensitive user data** without proper consent—violating Apple’s **Guideline 5.1** and Google’s privacy terms.

* **Mental Health Crises**: Victims face public shaming, job loss, stalking, and anxiety. These platforms profit while real people suffer.

---

### 💥 Why Target Payment Processors?

Without access to **Stripe, PayPal**, and other payment services, these apps **can’t function**. Once payments are blocked, app stores are more likely to **delist them** entirely—cutting off future users and revenue.

---

### 🎯 Who to Email:

> You don’t need to write a long essay. Just clearly explain how the apps are enabling harassment and defamation, violating privacy, and causing mental distress. Demand action.

n6drp36,1m8o9uq,MensRights,_WutzInAName_,"Info about a class action lawsuit against Tea below, from ZealousidealLet234:

Yes—a man can bring a lawsuit even if he doesn’t yet know whether he’s been posted, and in fact, the very fact that men are categorically excluded from access is itself a legally actionable harm.

Here’s why.

⸻

1.	⁠Exclusion Alone Creates Standing

Even if a man hasn’t confirmed whether he was “doxxed,” the denial of access based on sex—while allowing women to use the app freely—is itself: •	Gender discrimination under state civil rights laws (like California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act, which applies to all businesses, including apps). •	A deprivation of equal access to a commercial service, which courts increasingly recognize as a harm in itself (especially when paired with reputational risk).

That means any man could sue on the grounds that he is denied the ability to monitor, defend, or correct information posted about him.

⸻

2. The Catch-22 Actually Strengthens the Case

The app’s design—allowing women to post names, photos, and accusations while denying men the ability to know, verify, or respond—could be argued as: •	A due process and fairness violation (in civil contexts, not constitutional, but as a principle in consumer protection claims). •	An inherently discriminatory business practice because it creates a closed ecosystem where only one gender can participate, while the other is targeted.

This also bolsters arguments for injunctive relief (a court order to shut down or modify the app) even before damages are proven.

⸻

3. How a Plaintiff Could Proceed

There are two main routes:

A. Individual Lawsuit (Civil Rights/Consumer Protection)

A single man (even one who doesn’t know if he’s posted) could sue on the basis of: 1.	Being categorically denied access due to gender. 2.	The foreseeable risk of reputational harm because he cannot monitor or defend himself. 3.	Apple’s participation (hosting and profiting despite the discrimination).

B. Class Action

Because every man is excluded by design, attorneys could file a class action on behalf of all men denied access, seeking: •	Statutory damages (many civil rights statutes provide automatic damages per violation), •	An injunction forcing Apple to remove or alter the app, •	Potential punitive damages if the conduct is deemed reckless or exploitative.

⸻

4. How Apple Becomes Liable

Normally, Apple could hide behind Section 230. But: •	Section 230 does not cover civil rights claims, unfair business practices, or Apple’s own decision to distribute a discriminatory app. •	Apple profits directly (via App Store fees) and has developer policies explicitly banning apps that promote harassment or discrimination, so knowingly hosting this app could be framed as negligence or willful misconduct.

⸻

5. So, Can “Any Man” Sue?

Yes. Even without proof that he’s posted: •	The denial of equal access is enough to establish standing. •	The risk of reputational harm (since he cannot even check or appeal posts about him) strengthens the case for injunctive relief. •	If discovery later reveals specific doxxing or defamation, that can add damages claims.",2,2025-08-01 10:10:13,False,Tea App Megathread,227,2025-07-24 20:06:55,179,2024-09-27 17:07:03,14227,1363,True,False,"['MensRights', 'AWDTSGisToxic', 'TheTinMen', 'antifeminist']"

They share personal information for advertising and marketing purposes, something you must opt OUT of (through settings, email? not sure). Also allows data sharing for ""business deals,"" and with ""banking partners

Their supposed data aggregation claims are weak. Mentions data may be anonymized ""before sharing,"" but offers no clear anonymization standard. Pseudonymized data can often be re-identified, especially when it includes location, device, or behavioral signals.

She starts calling him by his first name right away as if he broke her trust by letting her. He shouldn’t have been attractive, her age, and instead of listening to her talk about her mental health, the mental health professional should have told her it was inappropriate. She just assumes he’s interested and there’s a conflict of interest because he’s hot and therefore leading her on.

Women May behave more aggressively towards women that they perceive as beautiful

Most relevant to my life is the body of research which shows that women are less likely to hire women that they think are pretty. One example is “Don’t hate me because I’m beautiful: Anti-attractiveness bias in organizational evaluation and decision making” by Agthe, Spörrle, and Maner was published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology in 2010 .

This has actually led me to personally not wear makeup and kind of muss myself up a bit for job interviews where I know that the interviewer is a woman.

I've also personally kind of subjectively noticed that it seems like in particular nerd women really really don't like other nerd women who are a conventional by attractive standards. In communities like tabletop gaming, larping, fandoms, the people who were really sidelining certain women in the community weren't so much men but other women who seemed to dislike that so-and-so wasn't really fitting the image of what a nerd girl looks like. I don't think this is so much true now as it was maybe 10- 20 years ago, but it was something that really stood out to me: whoever was the stereotypically pretty and feminine women at the LARP was always getting open hostility from other women, but not necessarily from guys.",2,2025-08-12 18:21:25,False,The Female Jealousy Epidemic,51,2025-08-12 16:41:03,7,2018-11-12 06:13:31,53858,13287,True,True,"['MensRights', 'PoliticalCompassMemes', 'worldnews', 'TikTokCringe', 'Amazing', 'Seattle', 'confidentlyincorrect', 'Preply', 'couchsurfing', 'AmIOverreacting']"

Let’s say a nice guy named Brad goes on a few dates with a woman, politely says he’s not interested, then moves on.

Until one day he finds one he falls in love with, who happens to be really attractive. They’re traveling to beautiful places, they get married, they buy a home, they start a family. 

Years go by, and one night one of the women who got passed is sitting alone in her house full of cats, miserable because she’s still single and drowning her misery in a bottle of wine, and she hears about these groups and the Tea app. Who do you think she’d going to look up or post about? All of her exes. Oh shit she found Brad from college and other girls already said he’s a narcissist and abusive even though nothing could be further from the truth.
