ksfc77c,1b0tls9,TrollXChromosomes,TheDankDiamond,"Misandrist thought can definitely share foundational aspects in misogyny though. The two are meant to be the same in a vacuum, and ultimately those who take the thought to the extreme end up at biological determinism based on sex. 

Misogyny can be subtle, that doesn't make it less harmful. Misogynistic people and systems now - families, teachers, workplaces - often don't admit or go to the extremities of women as purely sexual or domestic property,they may even use performative examples of unique high achieving women and label them role models, whilst still underneath believing in the inferiority of women. For example, it's very hard to outright deny that Marie Curie's contributions and Nobel prizes were somehow not important, but it's easy to pretend that her case is the exception and that women are ""ill suited"" for the sciences. 

This also applies to misandry, but in the opposite direction. Most women are very much taught to not trust and be very wary of the men they encounter in life. This is a kind of very normalized, and most often surface level, prejudice. Women are obviously very much avoidant of men alone at night but that doesn't prevent the development of meaningful relationships, unlike genuine, bigoted forms of prejudice? But this ""normalized prejudice"" *is taken* to the extreme with TERFism and ""gender critical"" ideology. And the kind of misandry spouted by TERFs isn't rare and it's not small scale. It drives transphobia in mainstream media.

The idea that trans women are predators - probably the most harmful stereotype, and the most common, that trans women face  - is rooted in a weird misplaced form of misandry. And the idea that trans men are confused and are only men due to internalized misogyny is, of course, also a form of misandry. These aren't small-scale non existent ideas buried deep on the internet. These ideas genuinely threaten trans people's legal rights and the right wing love repeating and repeating these ideas to scapegoat trans people and turn the public towards transphobia - which of course manifests into genuine threats for their safety.",2,2024-02-27 12:06:51,misogyny,Misogyny vs Misandry ✨

Edit for clarity since this is getting more than 3 views:

Misandry is a core part of patriarchy and besties with misogyny.  Just as society breaks women down to fit into certain molds, it demands men shave off and suppress themselves to fit into their molds as well.  In this sense, misandry does exist and harm men, although some would argue it's founded - or an extension of - misogyny.  bell hooks' The Will To Change discusses this way better than I can.

lvwsf7w,1glqv5p,DeepThoughts,Person1746,"**This is my take:**

Misogyny and sexism are holding boys and men back. Just as women were burdened with unrealistic expectations of being a “woman,” men have also been subjected to the narrow idea of what a “man” should be. Many men haven’t broken free from these expectations yet, which is part of why women are excelling while men are being left behind.

Many men still feel held to or believe in standards such as: men can’t show emotion without appearing weak, they must be the breadwinner, they must earn more than women, they must financially support a partner and family, and they must have money to attract a partner.

It’s just as unfair to them, but unlike women, they haven’t been empowered to break out of these stereotypes.

I also think that:

	•	Social media hinders young men’s (and women’s) development of adequate social skills.

	•	Parenting styles have shifted from an overly authoritarian approach to an overly permissive and enabling one. This doesn’t equip young people with the skills needed to “adult,” communicate emotions, or develop strong social skills especially affecting men since emotionally intimate friendships are not encouraged among male friendships, but are very common for women. Not to mention, in many homes boys are still not taught the same life skills as women. As adults, women look for these skills in partners. Like: cooking, cleaning, proper hygiene, taking accountability for their actions, adequate ability to communicate and regulate their emotions. 

	•	Many men struggle with their mental health but are less likely to seek therapy for it.

This has left many men feeling inadequate, less than, angry, hopeless, and searching for answers/someone to blame—often in the wrong places.

**Anecdotally:**

There are several young men in my life. One who is 26, has never moved out because his parents pay for everything for him, his mom still does his laundry and cleans his room, he speaks extremely disrespectful to his parents (he was modeled this by his parents), he does not drive, and he does not keep himself clean (regularly: shower or brush his teeth), he works full time, but spends all of his money on weed or booze, and yet he complains that women won’t date him because “all ‘women’ want is men with money to buy them things.” I blame the parents for this ultimately, however once you’re an adult, it’s your responsibility to change. 

There are also several boys in my family who are not being taught life skills: to cook, clean, express emotions, be responsible, be told ‘no’, be held accountable…

Edit: honestly, if therapy was mandatory for everyone it would probably solve a lot of this.",92,2024-11-07 07:32:00,misogyny,Misogyny runs very deep in my generation — and it’s scary.

I have consumed all the red pill and feminism stuff before but for some reason I feel really lucky to have not been roped into all that stuff. A lot of people don't know how to look at their path and circumstances in life and recognize where their beliefs and lifestyles come from. Or recognizing their thought patterns and how it actually helps or hurts them in real life situations. Kind of like thinking about how you think, is that just critical thinking? 

This is why in my opinion it is so dangerous to give some alleys of the internet access to kids and young teens because it's all just straight lies and bullshit all the time. This is one of the big things gen z is dealing with. To me it seems to be a combination of lack of opportunity for healthy social outlets, lack of good role models for both men and women, and almost a complete disconnect from the local community and neighborhood (and social media obviously). I never ever used any other social media other than reddit and I guess youtube.

More and more it seems like young boys (12-15 especially) don’t want to be seen like, obeying a woman in front of their friends. I don’t think this is necessarily worse now than it was in the past, but I think teaching is becoming even more female-dominated than ever, and this + that kind of general misogyny that makes it harder for female teachers to earn students’ respect makes student behavior worse overall. Based on my observations boys are quite responsive to male teachers with a strong presence who maintain a competitive, ordered environment…but there are basically none of those. And I do think some female teachers can have a weird style of kind of humiliating kids that it makes sense for teenage boys to rebel against. But it’s quite a challenge because if you’re a woman and you’re kind and patient with your students (so misogynistic male students won’t think you’re a bitch, but also because students deserve to be treated with kindness lol) they will walk all over you. It’s weird out there.

Maybe she’s a good enforcer of what the Big Man wants. But he is always going to be doing it at a more extensive scale, abstracting it harder into social conditions(“ha ha i love being more productive than those poor fucks”, “what a physically pathetic little twerp that manlet it”, “idiot not talented enough for my academic society lol” etc) and loving it more. That is a whole genre of man, though probably sub-10%, and their love of this game goes beyond occasional schadenfreude- it’s kind of what they’re made for, and much of the time it makes for a very pleasant life

 I guess males often assume that’s just a class thing or only happens under some narrow “impressing woman” parameter but these male bullies occur in every strata, are often very beneficial to society(these are often executioners, jailers, judges, law enforcement… exiling moral failures.. it’s not a sexual thing) and that urge will literally never be satisfied until every man who registers as a failure of his sex in some way is dead or far out of sight. Curating a civilization that does this automatically. Unfortunately for MRAs, they’re men so even if it’s unfair to weak males that is male-kind’s problem to solve

Otoh, misogyny is actually inescapable and primitive and insane without much real utility. Abstracted away from the reality of the woman usually, pretense is usually “vagina???”, often inflicted by men who aren’t even physically stronger than her(gang rape cultures lol), barely justified to the perp’s underdeveloped social circuits through those silly archetypes you’ve mentioned as an excuse. It can be managed but it will always be present outside very special conditions. So much more pointless, fickle and destructive, and there is little our sex can do to stop it without cooperative men.

n48ng9b,1m51jgp,science,Hrmbee,"From the article:

>In their study “‘Trying to talk white male teenagers oﬀ the alt-right ledge’ and other impacts of masculinist influencers on teachers,” co-authors Emelia L. Sandau and Luc S. Cousineau found that teachers, and in particular women teachers, are seeing a tremendous rise in male students expressing overt, and often violent, misogyny and male supremacy. In many cases, this misogyny is being directed towards teachers, including by undermining their authority in the classroom. The study, which analyzed teacher’s comments on Reddit, was published this summer in the peer-reviewed journal, Gender and Education.
>
>One teacher shared that they “had a student write a paper in graphic detail about how [sexual assault] victims ‘deserved’ it and ‘all women were asking for it’ and a lot of other extremely alarming sentiments.” They added, “the paper topic was nowhere close to anything like this, but he wrote it anyway.” 
>
>Another described male students making vulgar anatomical comments about their women teachers’ “holes” and “wetwet” — “to roaring laughter” from their peers.
>
>...
>
>The researchers used scripts to extract comments and posts from the Teachers subreddit, and filtered them for mentions of Andrew Tate in the title or text. While there is no way to determine where an individual is posting from, “the majority of posts on teachers signal to North American classrooms.” Through this filtering process, the researchers were able to identify and collect 2,364 comments from the teachers about Andrew Tate and his impact in classrooms and schools. 
>
>The study found that teachers are feeling “a variety of impacts from the discourses of misogyny championed by Andrew Tate.” As the study states, “it is clear from our research that Tate and other masculinist grifters are impacting teachers, the classroom, and North American school environments.” 
>
>The most prominent theme that emerged from the analysis of comments and posts in [the] Teachers [subreddit] about Tate’s influence was “the direct impacts on the teachers themselves, especially on women-identifying teachers.” Teachers shared that Tate-influenced male students’ outright refusal to respect their authority has led to increased challenges in classroom management. According to the study, “boys are clearly adopting misogynistic views and bringing them to the classroom.”
>
>...
>
>The study’s findings reflect concerns being raised by teachers all over the world. “Social media influencers are fuelling an increase in misogyny and sexism in schools,” according to a recent poll of 5,800 teachers in the UK. Over a third of 6,000 teachers surveyed by the BBC in April 2025 reported misogynistic behaviour from students in the previous week.
>
>This is not a new problem. In 2022, two women teachers from an all-boys school in New Zealand referred to Tate’s influence as “a new pandemic infecting schools across the country.” A 2023 Australian study found through interviewing women teachers that “the recent infiltration of Tate ideology and the resurgent masculinist supremacy reported by participants affirm that both the occurrences and character of sexual harassment and misogyny in schools has escalated.”

Abstract:

>Teachers are deeply affected by the same cultural influences as their students; directly and indirectly. This is certainly true in the rise of masculinity influencer, extremist, and alleged sex trafficker Andrew Tate and the brands of individual and cultural misogyny he perpetuates. Using data collected from the /r/Teachers subreddit community of Reddit.com, we explored how users discussed the influences of a (re)surging misogyny on the jobs of teachers and in classrooms. Users express that students are actively parroting male supremacist rhetorics at school and that is serving to devalue women teachers and make classrooms less safe. Discussion is framed using Deleuzian and masculinities theories to provide deeper analysis and interpretation of the data. We suggest that there is cause for concern regarding the immediate impacts, as well as long-term consequences of masculinist and male supremacist ideologies on youth, teachers, and schools.",1,2025-07-20 15:09:43,misogyny,Researchers at Dalhousie University have found large numbers of teachers dealing with explicit misogyny and male supremacist ideology in schools | ‘Trying to talk white male teenagers off the alt-right ledge’ and other impacts of masculinist influencers on teachers

While this quote refers to the colonists of Virginia, it also applies to now. Nothing is more intimidating to a straight white man than an educated ""other.""

So, they leave careers and education where women dominate, and blame those same women for why men aren't more prominent in those areas.

m518amq,1hr60fn,TwoXChromosomes,gvarsity,"What struck me as interesting is I agree the issue is misogyny but the mechanism is fear. Mostly the fear of ""losing"" to a woman.  Seeing themselves or thinking others will see them less than because women are better at whatever thing than they are.  Instead of rising to the challenge and doing what it takes to excel they run away.  

Which goes back to why they are often less competitive to begin with which is entitlement.  Many men have never learned how to prioritize beyond their immediate personal interest and do the work necessary to be prepared.   They often don't study, they don't want to learn the stuff that's boring but required.  Rather than accept that it is required they make argument like why should I have to do x it isn't fun/cool/interesting to me, as if that is the criteria for having core requirements in school.  

At the root of a lot of this is profound insecurity.  Men who are self confident and have an internal approval system and aren't basing their self worth on approval from every stranger on the street function much better.  One of the things about gay men and going through the coming out process is you essentially have to accept that broad hetero male approval is off the table which is liberating.   Once you are out of that sphere of toxic masculinity there is no fear of being less than because someone else in your classes may be better at the subject.",9,2025-01-02 09:03:42,misogyny,Why aren't we talking about the real reason male college enrollment is dropping?

On the one hand the OOP is over-exaggerating the misogyny of some of those trends and treating them as the worst thing ever.

But on the other hand there is a valid concern about the recent uptick in normalized misogyny that's been going around in women's spaces. There's been a pretty significant surge in ""woke patriarchy"" stuff that treats patriarchal norms as completely, 100% true, but tries to reframe them in a ""feminist"" way.

See: literally any ""feminine intuition/divine feminine"" spirituality practice, pink job/blue job, or the weird ""teehee I a woman I so EMOTIONAL"" stuff that seems to get really popular for no apparent reason.

Edit: just want to say, as I understand it, that the joke of “girl dinner” is that the person should be making themselves a meal fit for an adult woman, but is instead choosing to be lazy and revert to the junk food she scarfed down as a girl. The crux of it is that they’re a Millennial and therefore don’t actually feel like they’re fully an adult. It’s the same with “girl math,” the idea isn’t that women are bad at math, it’s that women are supposed to be adults who make good financial decisions, and this person succumbs to the same temptation to buy crap that they had as a teenager. I’ve heard this same interpretation on plenty of places.

This article mentions kids In kindergarten and having seen many examples in the gaming sphere, young kids will say anything to get the maximum effect. In general I feel most younger kids push boundaries it’s a natural part of growing up.
how many kindergarteners are in the “manosphere”, realistically it feels like a stretch unless it’s common to give your child unrestricted access to the internet but most things like YouTube have a family/kid friendly option (which has its own problems) but I would not think personalities like Tate would be propagated and in the end it’s much more likely a reflection of their home life.

I've haven't paid much attention to the manosphere but I'm sure there are some valid goals to strive for within these groups. Eating healthy, getting fit, playing team sports, competitiveness etc. But many in these spaces are likely being pushed into the worst parts of it by way of being told that men are horrible beings and that these groups are toxic. Some of these boys grew up seeing their fathers mistreated by their mothers so of course they won't take much heed to outside female voices. These boys are no doubt feeling isolated from society so reach out to the forums, Youtube videos, whatever platform it is to feel a sense of belonging.

Straight up finger pointing at these groups isn't the way to go. They can provide support and comfort to some who need it.

*""You just use the exact same test you would with far-right extremism and Islamism, wouldn’t you?*

*The same test would have to apply.*

*People can hold views about women all they like, but it’s not OK any more to ignore the massive growing threat caused by online hatred towards women and for us to ignore it because we’re worried about the line, rather than making sure the line is in the right place as we would do with any other extremist ideology.”*

She further said the new plans were about “looking at exactly what those definitions are” and filling in “gaps”. So they're explicitly not coming in with a definition in mind but trying to establish what it should be. 

And continued:

*“The National Police Chiefs’ Council (have) concerns about the growing rise in misogynistic attitudes among young men, largely because of online content they’re seeing.*

*This isn’t about criminalising people who are showing signs of an ideology, it is about preventing that ideology, and this piece of work the Home Secretary has announced today is about looking at the gaps.”*",23,2024-08-19 15:58:10,misogyny,Misogyny to be treated as extremism by UK government

To put it plainly, if you say “misogyny” instead of specific misogynistic behaviours, you’ll have way more people qualifying behaviours as misogyny. Teachers classify sexually degrading comments as misogynistic if they’re being directed at women, but would they call sexually degrading comments as misandrist if they’re directed at men? Is misandry a widespread problem now because every teenage girls insult for the boys is that his dick is small or that he doesn’t get laid?

**Researchers at Dalhousie University have found large numbers of teachers dealing with explicit misogyny and male supremacist ideology in schools**.

**In their study “‘Trying to talk white male teenagers oﬀ the alt-right ledge’ and other impacts of masculinist influencers on teachers,” co-authors Emelia L. Sandau and Luc S. Cousineau found that teachers, and in particular women teachers, are seeing a tremendous rise in male students expressing overt, and often violent, misogyny and male supremacy. In many cases, this misogyny is being directed towards teachers, including by undermining their authority in the classroom. The study, which analyzed teacher’s comments on Reddit, was published this summer in the peer-reviewed journal, Gender and Education**.

One teacher shared that they “had a student write a paper in graphic detail about how [sexual assault] victims ‘deserved’ it and ‘all women were asking for it’ and a lot of other extremely alarming sentiments.” They added, “the paper topic was nowhere close to anything like this, but he wrote it anyway.”

Men and women are spiritually equal, meaning that in God's eyes, we are equal.  Even though men have much more prominent roles in the church, women are just as important.  Yes, one of the main roles of women is to take care of the men and of the children, but what's more important is the balance the women bring.  Women, in my eyes, are there to keep men with God.  The stories of Ruth and Esther come to mind for this.  Women aren't tools for men to use and abuse, but for men to work with and be partners with.  To get to the Celestial Kingdom, to be with your family, Heavenly Father, and Jesus Christ for eternity, men and women must be together.  1 Corinthians 11:11-12, ""Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.

You can reasonably think that men face disadvantages on society that feminism refuses to acknowledge or handwaves away without accepting that men should treat women like shit because they enjoy it and it's the only way to be respected. That's the really venomous part of TRP ideology. ",193,2016-03-27 02:44:14,red pill,CMV: I think the Red Pill is mostly correct about women and society.
d1f43fh,4c4ypf,changemyview,[deleted],"I probably haven't spent as much time as you reading over at the red pill, but I've read a fair bit. So feel free to correct me if you think I'm missing the mark on anything, but here are my thoughts.

As is the case with virtually all group viewpoints, their assertions are based on kernels of truth that are natural to accept. Are there biological differences between men and women? Of course. Are their respective attraction tendencies based on different genetic priorities? Absolutely. Are men treated unfairly by society in certain situations? An argument can easily be made. The problem is in the way they apply this. 

The first major error you find is in the way their philosophy is oversimplified. They take just about everything a few steps further than their evidence suggests. Yes, men and women are different in some fundamental ways. But they take this handful of differences and create a ridiculous caricature of women. Just because some aspects of society favor women, they assume some sort of overblown conspiracy theory where feminists are trying to ruin their lives. You can see how their more reasonable views lead to their overblown ones, but a careful inspection of their logic provides no real justification for their conclusions.

The second major issue is their tendency to apply their views to absolutely everything they see. Not all women are the same, just like all men aren't. Many women are attracted to certain traits, but that doesn't mean all women are. Some of them have had bad experiences with bad people, but is that a reason to superimpose the traits they saw onto all women? It's intellectually lazy.

The social unfairness towards men is also not nearly as black and white as they make it out to be, and I say this as a man. First of all, they pretty blatantly ignore the challenges that women experience. They gender gap in pay comes to mind. And, sure, people are more suspicious of men in sexual situations. But it's hard to really blame society for that. Any statistics on the topic will show that men are overwhelmingly more prone towards violence and sexual assault. I don't condone painting men with too broad a brush, and I'm not saying that assumptions towards men are fair to apply to individuals. Not all men are the same. However the people over at the red pill respond to this oversimplified view of men by doing exactly the same thing to women.",433,2016-03-27 03:13:04,red pill,CMV: I think the Red Pill is mostly correct about women and society.
d1fa8pp,4c4ypf,changemyview,cybelechild,"What you talk about in your post doesnt seem to have much with Red Pill philosophy. You know - that men should be alphas, that women are these illogical, deceitful creatures, that these are built in from evolution, that 20 percent of men fuck 80% of women and so on. Those things are complete bullshit. I also do not think redpillers hate women - a few of them certainly do, but most simply have bad ideas and bad experiences. 

Instead you seem to talk a lot more about issues facing men in the modern world - and issues that have little to do with Red Pill ideas at that. In fact some of them are pure inertia from traditional gender roles - the same type of things that redpillers call for. Others are a result of our much more liberal and modern world. Third are due to activism gone wrong.

> We live in a very gynocentric society that is sexist against men. To give a few examples, men get longer prison sentences, are convicted at higher rates for the same crimes, and receive longer sentences for killing women than for killing men. (i.e. men are disposable)

A society that is sexist towards men is not necessarily gynocentric. Yes, there are many things that are sexist against men, but just the same there are many things that are sexist against women. Similarly - there are ways in which men can benefit a lot from ""the system"", but the same holds for women. It is just a s absurd to say we live in gynocracy as it is to say we live in a patriarchy. Instead we live in a system that has a lot of flaws, groups with different interests, and a lot of inertia from times past. 

>   We always assume men to be the aggressor in any encounter. Women actually commit more domestic violence than men, yet we always assume it's the man who is abusive. Another example, ""My husband tells me what I should wear"" Sounds bad right? How about ""My wife tells me what I should wear."" The first sounds worse because we assume that a man with some power in the relationship will abuse his power, but we don't assume the same for women.

It depends. The authorities would more often assume that men are the aggressors, on one hand because of feminist activism (like that famous Duluth model). On the other - the expectation that men are the strong ones (again what RP-ers want to push for), so its a double whammy.  In society - it would depend a lot on the subgroup - in traditional groups the men would get blamed more often, whereas in more non-traditional ones things should be more balanced. Most often it depends on the people, and their relationship to the abuser and the abused. You would see their friends and families siding with either side. 

 >  Men have to be extraordinarily careful not to sound like they are blaming women whenever they vent any sort of frustration or emotion. For instance, ""Why do women like that asshole and not me?"" is something that you might find mocked in /r/niceguys or /r/justneckbeardthings. Yet if a woman says something like ""Why does that guy like the hot girl but not me?"" she would be most likely receive sympathy. Men have to be super careful in choosing their words, which is ironic because we encourage men to express their emotions more. Yet when they do, we shame them for it.

However, the things in r/niceguys and r/justneckbeardthings are also mocked by redpillers. Then there is the thing that men and women do tend to communicate differently. Men are more direct and are much more likely to use insults and rude language in a non-insulting way. Women tend to be more considerate about their words, but also more hypocritical. And at least in my experience women spaces online tend to be more moderated. This means criticism and support will be expressed in an entirely different ways in  a mens space, compared to womens space

> Male sexuality is considered shameful. Men are considered creepy if they have a blow up doll, for an example. Yet it's perfectly normal for a woman to have a collection of dildos. Men are shamed if they date much younger women, even if she is a consenting adult.

True. But women have had their sexual revolution, and people fighting for normalising all these things for decades now. This has not happened for men yet, but again has little to do with RP. 

>  Perhaps this isn't too controversial, but women are attracted to status, masculinity, power, and good looks. They are more attracted to a man if other women want him. They are no less superficial in their sexual preferences than men. Weakness is unattractive to women. Being an emotional, sensitive man is a death sentence in the dating world.

Yes but so are men in regards to women. Everyone desires more the rich, powerfull and good looking partner. And even then preferences vary a lot. There are so many more things beyond status, masculinity and power. And I would say that being a super-emotional, sensitive woman is not much better. Nobody likes delicate flowers that breakdown at the smallest thing, regardless of gender. With women it is just slightly more accepted.

> RPillers have a right to be angry and upset because men are almost always blamed for everything. They are assumed to be the bad guy. TRP is the one place that they can get relief from this and where women can be the bad guy for once. I also feel like all women are partially responsible for their state. We should have been the ones to stand up and defend men. Men have a hard time standing up for themselves without being perceived as weak or misogynist.

I couldnt agree more with you on the last two sentences. The problem again seems to be twofold - traditional society and predominant activism. You know traditional gender roles are the ones RP-ers adopt - alpha male, with stoic looks, zero emotions and badass attitude. However this is the same role that does not allow a man to express his emotions, or discuss feelings and fears. Otherwise he'll be seen as beta. At the same time modern activism (looking at you, feminism) views men as having lives entirely made from sunshine and rainbows. Any complain is then discarded as male tears or a sign of male privilege. This ends up just as harmful as the RP/traditional view.

> The more power the man has in the relationship, the longer the relationship lasts and the more power the woman has, the unhappier the relationship.

I would really need a source on that. A balanced distribution of power, an open communication and ability to solve conflicts together is a much, much more important thing. If you dig into the research on love, attraction and relationships you would find that the Red Pill philosophy goes almost completely against everything we have discovered so far. I agree with you on the men's issues - they certainly are there. However the  Red Pill doesnt really seem to care about resolving these in a sane and mature manner - there are plenty of other people and groups with much less radical approach to the problem.

d1f3tyr,4c4ypf,changemyview,Grunt08,">We live in a very gynocentric society that is sexist against men.

We live in a society that recognizes significant differences between men and women and acts accordingly.  It's not that men are more disposable, it's that we're more violent and more dangerous when we're violent.  If my girlfriend punches me in the face as hard as she could, I'd probably get a bruise and maybe lose a tooth; she'd probably break her hand in the process.  If I hit her the same way, she might never wake up.  The same applies to fights with other people: if she gets in a fight or assaults someone, it's probably going to be another woman and neither is likely to cause serious injury.  If I get in a bar fight, it's probably with another grown man and we could both be in the hospital before the night is over, and one of us could be dead or permanently injured.

It makes sense to establish greater disincentives to violence on men.  I'm not saying current practice is wholly just, but that it makes sense given the differences that exist between the sexes and the biases they naturally produce.

>We always assume men to be the aggressor in any encounter.

See above.  We are, on average, taller, bigger, heavier, stronger, and more aggressive than women.  It makes sense to err on the side of caution and assume that the dangerous person is the aggressor.  And not to indulge too much in stereotypes, but we're generally okay with a woman telling her boyfriend or husband what to wear (in the sense that you said it) because we assume that women care more about and are more observant of fashion trends.  We don't assume the same of men, and this is borne out by our collective experience in the western world.  It's not some kind of malevolent sexism, it's just people recognizing and acting on a generally-observed difference that holds true in most cases.

>Men have to be extraordinarily careful not to sound like they are blaming women whenever they vent any sort of frustration or emotion. For instance, ""Why do women like that asshole and not me?"" is something that you might find mocked in /r/niceguys or /r/justneckbeardthings. Yet if a woman says something like ""Why does that guy like the hot girl but not me?"" she would be most likely receive sympathy

I think you're misplacing blame.  When a guy complains about a girl liking some asshole, there are two implications: 1) that the speaker's definitely not an asshole, and 2) that the girl in question doesn't really know what's good for her.  There are undoubtedly circumstances where those things are both true, but much of the time the person saying that is deflecting hard truths they ought to recognize.  They might be an asshole, they might be unattractive or awkward or have a laundry list of other problems that make them undesirable.  The guy they think of as an asshole might just be a confident dude the speaker resents for being confident.  The worst and most common one is that they think by being a nice person, they earn some sort of moral right to attention.

When this doesn't happen, too many guys conclude what the Red Pill does: that women actually want an asshole (rather than a confident grown-up who has his shit together).  Rather than improving themselves and building the necessary social skills and confidence to succeed on equal footing and have meaningful relationships, they try to play a game.  They jack the cynicism up to eleven, start viewing women as the enemy, usually fail miserably and do very little to fix the problem.  The irony is that many of the ""nice guys"" really do start out wanting meaningful, long-term relationships with women they respect, but the Red Pill cynicism actively inhibits that.

>Male sexuality is considered shameful. Men are considered creepy if they have a blow up doll, for an example. Yet it's perfectly normal for a woman to have a collection of dildos. Men are shamed if they date much younger women, even if she is a consenting adult.

As far as I know, women who date much younger men are also seen as creepy.  And a blow-up doll is just plain, flat-out, pants-on-head-crazy creepy.  It's also meant to resemble a person, and that leads us into a really uncomfortable cottage in the uncanny valley along the sexual compulsion highway.  Here's why men and women are different: dudes can make a very general approximation of a vagina with their hand, some women need a penis-shaped thing to get the job done.

Granted, I agree there's a bit of a double standard, but...it's on the level of ""manspreading"".  It really doesn't matter that much.

>Perhaps this isn't too controversial, but women are attracted to status, masculinity, power, and good looks. They are more attracted to a man if other women want him. They are no less superficial in their sexual preferences than men. Weakness is unattractive to women. Being an emotional, sensitive man is a death sentence in the dating world.

Okay...so we're all trying to date people we're attracted to?  Who ever said anything different?  That's not some unique red pill knowledge, anybody could've told you that.  Different women are attracted to different things; money is attractive in most people because it tends to suggest that they don't suck at life.  Many red pillers make the mistake of thinking all women want a provider and protector (of course, some do), but what most people want is someone with their shit together.  They don't want a relationship to cause more stress than it relieves.  They want someone confident and fun who can also afford to take them on a date that doesn't include a dollar menu.  It's not some neo-hunter/gatherer bullshit, it's just people looking for a good time and a good friend.

Emotional live wires don't make good dates.  If I was on a first date and she cried a lot, she would probably need to provide an explanation for that before there was a second date, because nobody wants to take on a project.  And yeah, there is a difference in gender expectation but...get over it.  You can be emotional, just keep control.  You can be sensitive, just don't be whiny.  Moderation, composure and a touch of dignity.  Dating is not where you unburden yourself to an almost-stranger, no matter which sex you are.

>RPillers have a right to be angry and upset because men are almost always blamed for everything. 

There is nothing less masculine than sitting around complaining about all the troubles and injustices the world heaps upon you - especially when your life is better than that of most people who've ever lived.  There's a great deal of merit in the fathers' rights movement and some other attendant MRA issues, but we really don't have it that bad.  Nobody in the first world who can be on the internet has it that bad.   We are not the victims of some huge injustice, women are not out to get us and most of the problems we may have with women at any point in our lives work themselves out over time.

The Red Pill is the wrong place to go looking for solutions; the little good they offer is at the bottom of a swamp.  Go to /r/fitness and start working out. Join a club.  Get a decent haircut and wear clothes that fit.  Learn how to shave right.  Keep good hygiene.  Keep your room or house clean.  Get enough sleep.

d1f6f00,4c4ypf,changemyview,werekoala,"RPill is what happens when a guy gets hung up on viewing women as objects for sexual gratification in a zero sum dominance game.  Especially when he's initially unsuccessful with women and feels like he's losing said game.

If you view women as emotionally stunted narcissists who trade sex for value, and behave in ways that would attract such women, it's no wonder that in a short time, those are the only type of women you see around you.

The reality is that women are complex and varied, just like men.  Some are sexually insatiable polygamists, some are seeking deep emotional and spiritual connection, some are shallow materialistic hedonists.  Some are focused on their professions, some are focused on their families, some are focused on themselves.  Some are overconfident, most are deeply insecure.  In short, they are a lot like men.

This is a self evident, obvious truth that takes an act of will - ""taking the red pill"" - to ignore it.  Far from being the a pill that opens your eyes to the big picture, it's a conscious decision to restrict your view of all women to a narrow one dimensional aperture.

But like any good self delusion, the red pill is seductively comfortable.  It conveniently takes all the blame off of the guy who follows it.  No, you're not a desperate, faintly creepy Nice Guy who needs to work himself.  You've been lied to!  You're a victim of the matriarchy!  And if you just learn our simple plan, you'll be hip deep in vapid sluts in less than a month.

Isn't that so much easier than developing genuine self confidence and a becoming the kind of interesting person that a grown woman might find worth her time?  Isn't it safer than developing genuine friendships with women without agendas?  Hell yes.  It's also shortsighted and unsatisfying.  Relationship junk food.

The problem is, a program that teaches you to act like an asshole in order to land the kind of immature women who find assholes attractive becomes self reinforcing.  Those are the only women you attract, and over time you begin to think all women are that way because that's all you ever see, and it's deeply unsatisfying.

Because heres another thing: especially as a guy, sex is the most important thing in life if you're not having any.  But once you start having reasonably satisfying sex on a routine basis, it stops being nearly as all-consuming.  You have a lot more time and mental energy at your disposal.  And if you're spending that time and energy on pursuing/maintaining the kind of shallow woman who is attracted to the red pill guy, you're gonna be miserable.  

The reality is, the philosophy doesn't even stand up top the most cursory scrutiny.  If you believe that women are basically whores who trade sex for favors, why not cut to the chase?  There are legal brothels, and plenty of illegal escorts anywhere.  Prices are reasonable, certainly less than you might spend on a nice dinner date, or on bottle service at a club.  Plus there are no games, no gimmicks, no guesswork.

The reality is, even as a guy, you don't just want sex.  You want someone to want to have sex with you.  You want that acceptance, you want to be desired.  That doesn't make you weak, that makes you human.

But you have a choice, and it's a critical one.  You can choose to get bitter when you feel undesired, convince yourself that you're a victim and that your only option is to strike back with equal ruthlessness.  This will work, to a point.  Plenty of shallow vapid women in this world, and you're welcome to spend your life chasing them.

Or you can choose to do some self reflection and personal growth to become the kind of person a deep, interesting, and confident woman would be interested in having as a life partner.  Takes a lot more time and effort, but I think you might find it worth it in the end.

One word for you: ""slut"".

There you have it. That women get constantly shamed for being even at all sexual is as obvious as the sun is bright. Slut, whore, tramp...you know what these words mean. So does every single person who has ever commented or visited RP.

The RP damn well knows the sun is shining but will sit there and tell you it's dark outside.

There are more women are killed by their current or ex lovers than the other way around. By a great number. Far more put in the hospital too. If you want to say abuse of men by women is not given enough attention, fair enough. If you want to pretend that it's a bigger issue than the other way around, you are out of your ever loving mind.

A red pill person is someone who can complain there is a social stigma for an older guy to date a younger woman, without even the tiniest bit of acknowledgement that there is an equal stigma for a younger woman to date an older guy, and a tremendously greater social stigma against older women and younger men.

""Oh, boo hoo. It's not fair that women are attracted to things. Now let me continue to completely ignore every woman that's not young, thin, and white."" Cry me a fucking river.

Red Pill people aren't being looked down on by women because men can't show their emotions. Red Pill people are frightened shitless of dealing with their emotions. Blaming everyone else for your problems in a tremendously unaware and hypocritical fashion isn't being honest about emotions at all. It's the complete opposite. It's someone who is incapable of coming to terms with their insecurities so has instead created a fantasy world where all of his own problems are actually everyone else's fault. (Or more specifically, roughly 50% of everyone else.)

The RP bigotry is at its roots the same as being a part of a white supremacist group. It's putting down another group of people to make up for one's own insecurities.

It's less the issues they raise that cause the backlash, it's more TRP's methods of handling them. They tend to be VERY adversarial, very judgmental based on superficial cues, and they have an obsession with weakness and power so they often seek conflict and dominance as a solution. It's not a healthy or productive approach, and like any online community dedicated to one topic or cause, they make each other's perception of the issues and solutions FAR more extreme than they should be.

>We live in a very gynocentric society that is sexist against men. To give a few examples, men get longer prison sentences, are convicted at higher rates for the same crimes, and receive longer sentences for killing women than for killing men. (i.e. men are disposable)

A few aspects of society are sexist against men. Custody issues are a massive problem, prison sentences, men who work with children being suspected of being pedophiles, etc etc. But other aspects are sexist against women. There's very very few women in positions of power at the highest levels. It's true that some of this is by lifestyle choice so it shouldn't be 50/50, but the glass ceiling is VERY real. Look at how every single female politician is absolutely despised by large segments of the general public. Clinton, Pelosi, Warren, Palin, the list goes on. No female presidents yet (we're close to having one, but Obama is president and racism isn't over either), hardly any powerful female politicians, hardly any female CEOs or business leaders, and so on. The male to female ratio is worse than a Magic tournament.

The first sounds worse because we assume that a man with some power in the relationship will abuse his power, but we don't assume the same for women.

The first two are absolutely huge problems that aren't being addressed in the mainstream nearly as much as they should. However, the second part would absolutely be considered unacceptable, at least in my general demographic. I've had a few friends who were in those situations and we basically had interventions shortly after we started seeing abusive/controlling behavior by girlfriends. It's true that being ""whipped"" is largely considered funny, but a lot of those situations are like ""ha ha, you have to make sacrifices to support your significant other!"" and don't actually describe abusive situations.

>For instance, ""Why do women like that asshole and not me?"" is something that you might find mocked in /r/niceguys or /r/justneckbeardthings. Yet if a woman says something like ""Why does that guy like the hot girl but not me?"" she would be most likely receive sympathy.

People don't like that first one because it assumes that most or all women want to be treated like shit, and encourages that behavior in those that want to get a girlfriend. Also, it frequently turns out that the ""asshole"" isn't really an asshole, he's just perceived as such by the guy who got rejected. A guy wouldn't be mocked nearly as much, if at all, for saying something like ""why do women only like attractive and confident guys?"" 

>Male sexuality is considered shameful. Men are considered creepy if they have a blow up doll, for an example. Yet it's perfectly normal for a woman to have a collection of dildos. Men are shamed if they date much younger women, even if she is a consenting adult.

On the other hand, women are slut shamed while men are praised for sleeping with lots of women, and much younger women are often shamed for being gold diggers. TRP is right that men shouldn't be shamed for these things, but they're wrong about this being a male-only issue. This is just our society in general.

You were absolutely 100% right about that until the last sentence. It's possible to be confident AND in touch with your feelings. That's called being well-adjusted. Keep in mind that people don't show all sides of themselves to everyone at all times, so the guy who appears confident and strong on the outside may be hiding a lot of himself that he only shows to the people he trusts most. It may help them get dates and start relationships, but men who never open up and aren't emotional or sensitive in private are the same who can't form long-lasting, fulfilling relationships. 

>The more power the man has in the relationship, the longer the relationship lasts and the more power the woman has, the unhappier the relationship.

Again, you started off in the right direction. Men have a right to be upset over these issues. Custody battles, prison sentences, domestic abuse, all of those are real issues.

You don't want to be perceived as weak? **Then cut this adversarial bullshit, stop playing the victim, and work productively towards a solution.** This goes back to what I said at the very top. Red pillers' obsession with power turns them into whiny bitches who blame everyone around them. Don't turn into this kind of person.

I'm pretty comfortable at this stage in history with seeing this trend as a reaction to the end of an era of mistreatment of women. We don't know much about our prehistory, but we do know that women have been getting the short end of the stick in terms of autonomy, legal protection, sexual exploitation and violence, etc for a very long time. 

Obviously, I can imagine that if a male is born in a westernized nation in the late 1990s today, they're going to be pretty frustrated that all of these burdens are placed on men. But let's be honest: how do these changes actually limit the ability to men to do what they need to do to be successful? Differential incarceration and child custody -- problems born of the same sexist assumptions that led to women being treated poorly in the first place -- are probably the only real issues that I would say need to be openly addressed.

Men watching their language in mixed company? An expectation that men will act civilly in response to ""no""? Every concern you raise could have been equally applied to the integration of the races. In time these requirements will simply be integrated into the social fabric.

> Being an emotional, sensitive man is a death sentence in the dating world

That perception exists because most emotionally healthy men entered committed relationships early in their lives and they are, for the most part, happy where they are and no longer dating. Seriously, I'm a 46 year old male, and every male friend I made in HS/college has been married for 20 years. EVEN THE GAY MEN are monogamous. I'd describe ALL of them as ""emotional and sensitive"". All of them have kids. And the few who aren't in committed relationships? They may be OK guys to hang around, but it's obvious to everyone why they're not settled down: drinking, casual swearing, generally shitty attitude about women and kids. We all know those guys.

d1ff4x8,4c4ypf,changemyview,beenpimpin,"It's easy to get swept up in brainwashing ideologies. Men and women have different challenges in society so women will find things harder than men do.

Let me address each one of your points but I doubt you'll see because you've already received 630 comments:

* I don't know much information about this so I won't spend too much time on it but off the top of my head I'd say that men are the more violent members of society. They commit majority of violent crimes so it's understandable that they'd be treated with harsher sentences because they seem less reformable. It's like you severly punish a bad child but you let the good child off with a warning when they do something wrong. 


* Men actually have a choice in an aggressive encounter. They do have the capability to fight back and punch a girls lights out. When a woman is being abused by a man she is literally defenseless in that moment. Nothing she can do will save her. A man can always punch her in the face and it'll put a stop to any physical abuse she is dolling out. Or atleast he can run away or pin her down. A woman cannot run away or pin him down. 


* Your example is men mocking men for venting their jealousy of other men. But women attack each other also in similar situations where they become jealous of each other. Men don't attack each other out of jealousy or hold resentment for each other. So we both have to take it in some form or another from our respective groups.
 

* Men have creep shaming women have slut shaming. When a man brags about all the pussy he gets he is applauded. when women brag about all the cock she is chastised for being a slut. When a man hits on women he's a creep, when a woman hits on men she's a floozy. And women with dildos are considered desperate. Also, men can openly talk about how much they masturbate whereas women can't because she'll look like a sex hound or desperate for a date. 


* Given this point we could say that because she is attracted to such a broad range of things like money, status, personality, looks that it makes it easier for men to be selective when finding a mate. If a woman is ugly her options drop dramatically. This forces women to be obsessed with looks. If I'm ugly atleast I can be rich or be funny and still get plenty of dates. the opposite is not true.  And being emotionally sensitive is not a death sentence. Sure, he may get rejected from time to time but if he is honest with his emotions and isn't trying to cover insecurities with false behavior, women will accept him. Michael Jackson was one of the emotionally sensitive men in the world but women would feint in his presence. That's because Jackson embraced his sensitivity and didn't apologize for it. 


* Bullshit. Women are always looked down upon when they try to be assertive or persuasive. A persuasive women is looked upon like a ""conniving bitch"" and an assertive woman is looked upon like a ""bossy bitch"". 


* What's your point? How is that bad for men? Maybe I'll report you to the mods for not being sincere because it looks like you maybe a dude pretending to be a genuinely concerned women so you can spout your red pill philosophy bullshit. 


The Red Pill boys lack a lot of real life experience and perspective. They have very little experience with women and they take their insecurities out on women because they don't have the courage to man up and walk their own path. Instead they decide to fall back into the shadows and complain to each other about how it's the womens fault they suck  at life.

It's not far-fetched to say that young men of today are increasingly being left behind by society in a number of ways. Look at suicide rates among them. Look at how they perform academically. Why this happened is complex and is probably in part an overcorrection when we shifted to giving more advantages to other demographics. Something which had to happen, by the way. There are people - rightly - championing the rights of women, ethnic minorities, gender/sexual minorities et al. But who's championing the rights of the straight white male? Nobody. The idea [is ridiculed](https://youtu.be/bTHEznqYSMQ?t=2377) over and over again. At some point, young men just feel abandoned. Even well-meaning attempts to redefine masculinity as something less toxic end up being a variation of ""treat women better"". Something which is true, but why must masculinity be defined in terms of how men interact with women? 

Now imagine there *is* someone who stands up and says ""I will fight for your rights"". It's going to be very tempting to people who have, or feel like they have, no other avenue to go down. Sadly that's the vein the likes of Andrew Tate have tapped into. But what alternatives are being offered?

For some it frames dating and gender dynamics as strategic systems they can “hack,” offering clarity in an uncertain world. Others are drawn by its critique of modern societal structures, which can validate their frustrations about personal or systemic struggles that they have thus far failed to take a positive oriented action on fixing themselves (makes it so they can blame others rather than take accountability for their own actions).

m6ozqti,1hyym1c,NoStupidQuestions,tikierapokemon,"It used to be that most women married, because being a single woman through adulthood/old age without ever marrying was extremely hard.  Society frowned on it and there was a stigma, women were discriminated against when it came to jobs, home loans, etc.  When my mother was growing up there was still a male/female segregated job adds - it lasted until 1971 through 1973.  

Birth control didn't exist until the 60s - so getting pregnant pretty much meant having a baby and being discriminated against the rest of your life if you weren't married.

So, the bar was pretty low for men who wanted to marry. 

Now women can get an education, they can support themselves, and they can be very picky when it comes to marriage - which means they can be very picky when it comes to dating.

I am Gen X.  When I was growing up, large swaths of people still thought of things as boy things or girl things, and the boy and boy things were of more importance and more status.  I had more than one relative that had more children than they wanted until they had the coveted son, and then that son could do no wrong and the girl children were treated as lesser.

So a whole bunch of my generation was still raised as boys better than girls and with the idea that all women wanted more than anything to be married.   And the ones with that belief system are more likely to have kids young, because they are looking for women who also believe that, and those women aren't going to college.  

Then modern times hit.  Women are being picky.  You have to not only be a potential paycheck, you have to have a good personality, treat women well BY THEIR STANDARDs, not the male standards you have been raised with.  The economy changes such that you unlikely to do as well as your parents.   To live a decent life, you need two incomes, but very, very few women are willing to split the bills/rent 50/50 and still do the majority of the housework and childcare - they want men who will pull their weight in more than the financial sense. 

And then there is a religious political movement that wants to tell you that you have a right to expect to women to fulfill their traditional role without forcing you to be the sole income.   That women are lessor, they need a man to make sure they are guided to correct behavior.  You can have your bills 50/50 and not do childcare/housework - that is the way it is supposed to be.

So young men angry they have to do more work than previous generations to get a woman, angry that they can't have it as good as their parents generation, with entitled thinking that women are asking for too much meat extremely misogynistic figures that tell the they are right, their thinking is correct, and if they only do these steps, they can have what they want.

But then those steps only get them gold diggers that are not willing to do 50/50  financial or women who get tired of the unevenness, and so forth.  

And then then get angrier, and the red pill types tell them they are correct, and that it's the fault of women being unnatural, and that is easier to continue to believe than that they did something wrong, and they need to change.  And since women will have access to the eternal internet, outliving your misogyny will be hard, so why bother to try?",11,2025-01-11 20:09:35,red pill,Why are so many young men feeding into this red pill narrative?

The red pill is very useful in intersexual dynamics and human relationships. It helps show you the true colors of how men and women work together and some things men need to be aware of. You don’t have to do anything it says. Rollo Tomassi is the “godfather of the red pill” and he’s the author of “The Rational Male” series. I’ve read all the books multiple times (except for the religion one). 

I didn’t want to believe anything that was in those books. Why? Because it went opposite of my core values and belief systems that I was raised with. However, I experienced some very traumatic things in my marriage that made me go look for answers. As fate would have it, I was recommended this book (the first “Rational Male” book in the series). I bought the audiobook. 

At first, this book was very hard to get into, and it was almost very player / pick up artist like. However, I persisted to read it, and the reason why it’s like that upfront is because it’s setting the tone so you understand the rest of the book which hits as hard as a bag of 1000 hammers across your face. 

Again, I didn’t want to believe anything that was in these books. It floored me. My entire belief system was a lie. 

But, like everything else that I question, I test it in real life against personal experience. I do the same thing with diets and fitness programs, etc. I try it to see if it’s valuable and holds water. 

I’m here to tell you, as someone who has been through the depths of hell in relationships and has had things about his divorce written about in books (yes it’s true), the stuff in the rational male is spot on. Sad, but true. 

Upon realizing it, you have to go through the five stages of grief because you realize you’ve been sold a lie your entire life about intersexual dynamics and often your core belief systems around relationships are destroyed and have to be rebuilt. It’s hard. Scary and depressing at the same time. But on the other side is a brighter future. 

I’ve tested various different things the books said over the years just to see if they would work, and they do, and it’s almost sickening. It’s sad. It’s sad that this is the way intersexual dynamics are now. 

Rollo said it best in his first book “it’s like seeing the code in the matrix, and once you see it, you can’t unsee it”. This is true, I see things now that I’ve never seen before and I can’t unsee it. I can detect the intentions of predatory women and men quite easily now. I can detect true authentic compassion and desire. 

Due to this, I’ve avoided terrible horrendous, relationships that could’ve been catastrophic. I’ve seen red flags that were major that I would’ve ignored before. They are now very bright. 

I’ve been able to determine what I really want in my life and in a partner, and what that really means in regards to a successful relationship between a male and a female. 

Since learning all of this, I’ve been the happiest I’ve ever been all my life. 

In regards to the red pill in general, I would avoid anything that you see on Instagram or any podcast or anything in the nature. If you listen to what Rollo says, he’s very intelligent in regards to intersexual dynamics. You have to read between the lines of everything that said. Pick up the message.  Learn from it and use it as a tool to better your life. 

However, if you begin following influencers and content creators who post nothing but red pill content, you’ll find yourself becoming miserable and seeing the world as a zero some game that can’t be won. 

Here’s a thing though… It can be won, but you have to do the hard work. You have to get your fitness right, your money right, your style right, etc. You just don’t want go down that social media red pill rabbit hole.  That’s bad. 

Use the red pill as a set of tools to help you make better decisions. Realize the true nature of intersexual dynamics, even though it’s a very bitter pill to swallow.",4,2024-12-09 17:56:53,red pill,Thoughts about red pill as a man?

People think of red pill as an ideology, some think it toxic.  I can say there’s representatives that espouse their particular brand of red pill interpretation, and others who consider themselves “aware” of male/female intersexual dynamics, not bothering a soul.  

I tend to tune out the Tate’s and F&F crew.  But what I do is be very aware of some of the ways these dynamics work.  I work in probabilities whilst many work on possibilities.  And a lot of the topics RP covers is based on statistics and studies.

m1ak9fx,1hapwut,AskMenAdvice,sockalicious,"Red pill has evolved quite a bit since I first ran into it in 2013 or so, and not in a good direction.

What I took away from it that was helpful to me:

* It's OK to want what you want out of a relationship, and then go get it.

* Women have things they're looking for out of a relationship too.  Often what they say about those things  isn't perfectly matched to reality.

*  If spending time alone with yourself doesn't make you happy, don't expect it to make a woman happy.  Conversely: once you're good company for yourself, women will crave your company too.

*  There are specific techniques you can master and concepts you can learn, to make implementing everything mentioned here much easier.  Some of the concepts that helped me were approach anxiety, peacocking, day game, frame testing and lifting weights.

*  There is a whole section under the title AWALT - all women are like that.  Turns out women don't want to be with unattractive or low-status men.  Wow, mind blown.  Now, get this one secret truth doctors hate: women \*do\* want to be with attractive / high-status men.  There, I said it.  Burn me at the stake.

None of it seems particularly revolutionary now, but it's possible to be a single 40 year old man who doesn't know any of it.  Ask me how I know.  (Actually, I already knew how to lift weights.)

Trying to reverse engineer social strategies by applying logic and reason to them is something that societies and their members tend to frown upon, and for good reason - it's destabilizing.  This is explicitly part of red pill thinking - Morpheus tells Neo 'most of these people aren't ready to be freed,' it was practically a catchphrase - and truly understanding why was useful to me in other domains.",3,2024-12-09 17:48:44,red pill,Thoughts about red pill as a man?

m1axrrw,1hapwut,AskMenAdvice,briber67,"Red Pill is one of the most misunderstood concepts on the internet. 

Part of that is due to the fact that Red Pill is not expressed in the form of an orthodoxy.

Instead, Red Pill is an empirically derived *orthopraxis*.

This is an important distinction.

An orthodoxy defines a correct set of thoughts/beliefs.

An orthopraxsis describes a correct set of behaviors.

In the context of Red Pill, those correct behaviors are  whatever it takes to get a woman to *consensually* allow one to take her to bed.

I say that it is empirically derived. This is a direct consequence of the widespread adoption of the internet. The Player movement that began in the late 1990's was facilitated by the internet. Specifically in the context of online forums. These forums allowed members to contribute *field reports* that documented interactions with women in detail with the intent to replicate successful outcomes (i.e. sex with the particular woman).

Now, the Red Pill movement has since become encrusted with a great deal of anecdotal attempts at explanation of the mechanisms that undergird human behavior in the context of sexual attraction. These stories accumulate like barnacles on a ship's hull. They are not the ship, but you will encounter them in quantity in a purely surface level investigation of the ship. 

If you dive into what comes across at first glance as Red Pill's *""orthodoxy""*, most people will come away with their jaws on the floor. What kind of damned fool things are these people yaking about?

But...

Red Pill isn't an orthodoxy. 

There is no set of approved knowledge or correct beliefs.

Red Pill is an orthopraxis.

Do these things to improve the odds that you'll be able to bed your desired woman.  

If the odds consistently improve from less than 1::100 to better than 1::10, then Red Pill is empirically validated.

This whole concept can be likened to the philosophical concept of *phlogiston*.

For nearly 150 years, the phlogiston hypothesis was the ""correct"" explanation of combustion. 

Objects that were combustible possessed phlogiston. 

Objects lost their phlogiston through the process of combustion.

Once an object had lost all its phlogiston, it was rendered no longer combustible. 

Easily explained. Internally consistent. Enabling of correct predictions. 

But...

Entirely WRONG. 

Still, just because someone has fucked up ideas that explain combustion doesnt mean that they cant start a fire when they want to.

Some terms are defined loosely. And red pill is certainly one of those.

As an example to some people it might mean as little as commentary on certain perceived inequities in the divorce laws. On the other end you have well Andrew Tate.

I'm not representing that that's the whole spectrum. I'm just giving you an example.

I think essentially any movement has some positives. And likewise any movement when taken to extremes can lead to disaster.

As a rule when someone describes that they're a member of any movement I give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they're referring to the more benign aspects unless and until they give me reason to believe otherwise.

Most Christians don't burn witches. And most people who mention red pill don't have a harem like Andrew Tate.

Hard disagree, birth rates are a cultural issue. We live in a society where career and pursuit for empty materialism (Myself included, not trying to make myself morally superior) are encouraged instead of social Duties. Companies activly discourage women getting kids, because that would mean they lose a valuable employee for AT LEAST 9-12 months, often times even more because the women settles down.  
And even without companies, families are also often discouraging their kids from becoming parents to early (altough this is largely a case by case basis) and most women generally also prefer a career over becoming a parent, because they like men want to live a living standard which is simply not attainable with just one of the two parents working.

Birth rates will drop and nothing will stop it until our economic System collapses or takes a heavy toll and people cannot rely on wealth anymore to be happy. Dropping the red pill changes nothing, even if these men hook up with women, they will either birth no child or just one which is far too few to keep the birth rates stable",2,2024-11-22 08:49:39,red pill,Red Pill has ruined the current dating and marriage scene.

I say if men want to live better, they just own up and have confidence. Accept and work with the feelings that men and women have. And get over it when women reject them or don't behave the way they want. They should be respectful and find someone worth it, and when they do it should be 50/50.

I could defo do what I just did multiple times a day. Within a year, keeping up an average of 10k I'd have 3.65m. By year 4 I'd have outpaced the invested 10m, and that's assuming I didn't invest any of the snap money or place any in a savings account. That's also assuming the invested 10m made money every year and there wasn't a major market crash

Also another point is that once the 10m is gone, it's gone. Being able to snap whenever you need money is infinite (unless you lose your fingers).

It just doesn't happen. Rock bottom, for them, is costing them friends, family, and keep getting dumped.

What they do, when confronted (and, I do it all the time) and loose the argument, is go into ""stealth mode"". They no longer express their true views, unless talking to other proven red-pilled guys. Every once in a while, a really subtle hint may slip out. But, they catch themselves and don't do it again, for a while. 

My 40 year best friend's son just did this with his dad, uncle, and I last year. We all know his views haven't changed, he's just learned not to express them publicly outside the incel groups he belongs to. It's obvious because whenever subjects regarding women come up, he has nothing to say. His total silence, speaks volumes. 

OP, don not waste precious minutes of your life trying to talk him out of this mindset. It won't work. You will always be a second class citizen, to him.

Abstract

The Dark Triad (DT) is a set of personality traits consisting of subclinical psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism. Separately, The Red Pill (TRP) is a seduction community part of an online men’s movement that advocates incorporating DT traits and behaviors in romantic or sexual relationships with women. This study investigates the potential presence of DT influences in relationships with TRP-affiliated men as described by former romantic partners. Using a directed content analysis of six semi-structured interviews, four thematic categories emerged: relationship development, coaxing, outward appearances, and DT-associated Internet behaviors. TRP men consistently displayed self-interest and willingness to use manipulation to meet their needs, portraying themselves to their partners and the world as successful while callously disregarding partners’ emotions in their pursuit of sex or social desirability. Participants’ experiences of TRP men’s behaviors aligned with prior knowledge regarding DT-associated romantic and sexual relationships. This research may be used to inform future research connecting DT personalities and maladaptive social groups, as well as generating prevention strategies among relationship-based practitioners.

From the linked article: 

A recent study published in the journal Personal Relationships explored how personality traits associated with manipulation—known as the “Dark Triad”—are reflected in the dating practices of men in the “Red Pill” community. Women previously involved with Red Pill men described partners who showed patterns of self-interest and emotional detachment, often using manipulation to achieve their goals. These findings suggest that Red Pill teachings may encourage or attract men with traits linked to a willingness to manipulate others in relationships.

The study’s findings reveal a significant overlap between the personality traits associated with the Dark Triad and the behaviors promoted by the Red Pill community. Women who had been in relationships with Red Pill men described a distinct pattern in which their partners exhibited self-centered and manipulative behaviors aimed at fulfilling personal needs, often at the expense of emotional connection. These relationships were marked by an intense focus on image, success, and control, aligning with the traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy found within the Dark Triad.

One central theme that emerged was the quick escalation of these relationships. Many women described how Red Pill partners would rapidly push for deeper commitment or intimacy early in the relationship. This pattern of “love-bombing” helped establish control quickly, often leaving the women feeling overwhelmed or unprepared to set boundaries.

Red Pill men also placed a strong emphasis on the role of sex, viewing it as a foundational element of the relationship. This pressured the women into conforming to their partners’ expectations, sometimes to their discomfort. These early pressures often led to women moving in with their Red Pill partners sooner than they would have liked, reinforcing a dynamic where the men could exert greater control over daily interactions.

Another significant finding involved the concept of “coaxing,” where Red Pill partners used psychological tactics to manipulate their partners’ emotions and decisions. This included strategies like “dread game,” where Red Pill men would subtly threaten abandonment to encourage compliance. In these situations, the women were left feeling anxious and eager to placate their partners to avoid conflict.

This emotional manipulation took various forms, from guilt-tripping over minor issues to intentionally provoking the women to get a desired reaction. For instance, one partner might leave messes for his girlfriend to clean up, establishing her as responsible for the domestic work, or use passive-aggressive comments to make her feel guilty about not meeting his standards.

The study also uncovered how these men were preoccupied with their outward appearance and social status, aiming to portray themselves as successful, powerful, and attractive “alpha” males. This image management was a recurring theme, with Red Pill men often fixating on displaying their physical fitness, material success, or intellectual superiority.",113,2024-11-14 13:04:29,red pill,"“Dark Triad” personality traits are reflected in the dating practices of men in the “Red Pill” community.

So the red pill rhetoric is trying to force single moms back to that underclass layer which is the labor backbone that allows men to be free of accountability.",77,2025-07-11 04:13:18,red pill,Why is the red pill propaganda so against single moms ?
n2j07xs,1lx2u6o,AskFeminists,GuardianGero,"I hate that I know the answer to this, but they consider single moms to be ""used up."" Red pill guys are the most insecure people on Earth, so the idea that a woman has been with another man - even had children with him - is violently repulsive to them.

Plus, they consider children to be an automatic emotional and financial burden, as if dating someone with kids will ruin their lives. I've had conversations with more than one person here on Reddit who *absolutely lost their minds* when I pointed out that dating someone with kids is fine, actually, and can in fact be really great.

Ultimately, the only kind of woman these guys can accept is one who has no experience with other men.

To red pill poppers, single moms are the ultimate proof that women are to blame for being attracted to and choosing the “wrong” type of guy or not being smart enough to see through the bad guy’s charm and lies.

Pill poppers also hate talking about the choices of shitty men who abandon their families and kids. These types of conversations aren’t meant to be a logical dissection of interpersonal relationships and gendered issues for them, it’s a self-soothing experience to be self righteous and shit on single moms.",6,2025-07-11 07:00:14,red pill,Why is the red pill propaganda so against single moms ?

The personal part: if you're with a single mom, the father will always be around and you won't ever be the father of her child. You're also not as important as said children for her (if she's a good mom). So the red pill will tell you ""don't date single moms"". It's not too bad if it stays there, they're just limiting their dating pool.

The societal part: children raised in single parent household tend to be over-represented in criminal statistics. They'll add the fact divorce are usually initiated by the woman in the couple (because who's doing most of the official paper work?) and the fact courts in the US tend to have a preferential treatment for women and suddenly women are the root cause of crime in the US.

You could add a pinch of ""now that they have the pill she chose to have children"" and everyone has an anecdote from a friend of a friend of a friend who's heard about the girl who decided to trap her man with a surprise child. Maybe reheat some old welfare queen propaganda to go with it. And now you get some problematic views cooking. Just add the fact social media apps tend to give you what will enrage you the most and you'll get the same video of said anecdote multiples times per day in your feed.

Their issue more is that weird meme in which: hot girl ignores nerd and goes for jock, jock knocks her up and abandons her for another hot girl, single mom now tries to go for successful nerd, nerd rejects her because he can get thousands of new hot girls. 

To put that in plain speak: the red pill guys blame single moms for “picking the bad guy” to date and have kids with when they should have “picked the quieter, nerdier dude who would have treated her like a princess and been such a good dad” (in their imagination).

Their opinion is that this is such an obviously disadvantageous situation for the man that he would only accept it if he were desperate, and the woman took advantage of that desperation to manipulate him for her own benefit.

n2izm3e,1lx2u6o,AskFeminists,Useful-Fish8194,"My two cents on this:

- because single mothers are already a heavily stigmatized group, making them easy targets

- because they are proof that trapping a woman with children doesn't necessarily work

- single moms are excellent scare-tactic material for them since they are so stigmatized (""if you don't act in way xyz your man will leave you and you will he a single mom"")

- they see women as less valuable with every men she slept with, having a child with a guy probably makes her ""uber tainted"" in their world view 

- they loathe that the child won't be influenced by a man as much growing up

- this might be a controversial take: if I remember correctly, sons of single moms are more likely to adapt misogynistic world views and are worse off in life in general (not surprising given how much single moms and their kids are shunned by society), consequently it is likely that many red pill guys are the sons of single moms, so the hate might be a projection rooted in genuine pain from having an absent father, seeing their own mom struggle, being shunned",5,2025-07-11 03:50:46,red pill,Why is the red pill propaganda so against single moms ?

Most of my life, Ive been blue pill. I was always hungry, always thinking about the next meal, and got happy feelings from eating foods I loved.

The past five years, my relationship with food has completely changed and I’m now red pill. I’m not sure what shifted, but I don’t seem to get dopamine or serotonin from food anymore. I’m one of the “oops I forgot to eat” kind of people now. Food is a chore now, and an afterthought. Even when I eat food I used to get excited about, it’s just… blah now. This has made me anywhere from 5-15 pounds lighter than I was in my blue pill phase.

It’s easier being red pill, gotta say:
1. Clothes being a little loose feels so much better than clothes being too tight.
2. Thinking about food constantly was a burden. I felt like I had to hold myself back or I would stuff myself sick. It feels SO NICE to be free from the chokehold food used to have on me.

I do miss getting joy from food. However, I’d rather food be the neutral, background thing it is now than the crazy rollercoaster ride of ups and downs it used to be.",1,2025-05-22 14:34:20,red pill,First time red pilling since medicated!

Traditional masculinity is about being a  true provider and protector of the family. And cheating (while im sure it was just as common) isn't a key component. Nor is disrespect,  and outright misogyny for the sake of hate. 


You mention insecurity,  which is a key component. Traditional men weren't afraid of ""being men"" and being taken advantage of. They understand the benefits of traditional family and the woman as an alternate head of household. 


You'll often see this masculine insecurity oozing out all over the place in modern society. There was a post on here yesterday of a wife/mother that is a high earner ($1mil annually) that wanted to take a break from work. The husband was supportive of her doing so. But the dual million dollar income home was getting feedback from men about how dare she think she should get a break and not fire the nanny. If she is going to take a few months off, she should also be the sole caregiver. And also the husband should have full control of the finances.

Women don’t need financial support like the past so if you are a man and can’t provide emotional support, you might as well be useless. The days of just provide and protect are gone, women need you to pivot to whatever the house needs wether it be chores or venting support And 2. There are groups of women that date ""like men"". Meaning they are here to smash and pass and will leave you in the dust. No issue with this as women should be able to dish it out as they have been taking it forever but it is a factor.

That being said …

It is never fun when you learn that people you love and look up to are talking behind your back. I am glad your daughter is learning the lesson that “there is no hate like Christian love” before she’s dedicated decades of her life to the church (and, possibly, has the complications of a family and children of her own), but I’m so sorry it had to happen at all. The best thing you can do is exactly what you’re doing — be there for her, comfort her, and give her a safe space to figure it out. Be aware that she may be disillusioned with the *church*, but that doesn’t mean she doesn’t still believe in and want to worship *God*. Nor does it mean she won’t decide that the correct course of action is to simply switch to a different church, perhaps one that’s more liberal leaning.

It sounds like she’s got a great support system in place to help her through this time.

fqzr0n5,glnf5o,OutOfTheLoop,PhiloBruh,"Answer: 
""Take the red pill"" - means to wake up to the truth, as it was portrayed in the movie The Matrix. 

Most likely Elon is referring to the current situation of everyone being in social distancing and isolation due to Covid-19 as he openly disagrees with this measure of diseases control because of the effect on the economy and his businesses in particular. 

There are many people who use this phrase to mean many different things, to understand where Elon is coming from in this regard you should see what he has been talking about on his social media platforms recently and that should provide context. He also did a podcast on YouTube with Joe Rogan which might help you understand his position.",7094,2020-05-17 20:42:29,red pill,"What's up with Elon Musk's recent tweet ""take the red pill""?"
fqykkze,glnf5o,OutOfTheLoop,mugenhunt,"ANSWER: In the movie, The Matrix, the world that the average person knows is a lie. In that film, the main character is presented two pills. The Blue Pill will allow him to forget the knowledge that the world he knows is false, and to continue living in that illusion. The Red Pill will allow him to truly awaken and escape from the illusion.

Since then, a lot of people have used ""the Red Pill"" as a metaphor for rejecting society's norms about gender and race. Saying that they're rejecting the illusion that society says about treating women as equals but instead that women must be treated as property.

While Elon's use of ""take the red pill"" in context can mean ""wake up to the real truth"" as Elon has been a critic of how the US government, and California in particular, are acting in regards to Covid-19, many people also believe that Elon is also aware that the term has been co-opted by people opposing feminism.

There is a popular response to Elon's tweet by Matrix co-writer Lilly Wachowski, a trans woman who is quite upset that a metaphor she made in her film has been used by people who would oppress those like her.",5025,2020-05-17 14:15:01,red pill,"What's up with Elon Musk's recent tweet ""take the red pill""?"
fqytmrx,glnf5o,OutOfTheLoop,AloneAddiction,"Answer:  ""Red Pilled.""

>Red pill comes from the 1999 cult classic film, The Matrix. There’s a scene early on in the movie in which the main character, Neo, is offered two pills: a red one and a blue one. The red pill represents an awakening, but one that could be difficult and painful. Neo’s world will be changed uncomfortably if he takes the red pill, but he’ll be made aware of the truth of the world. The blue pill represents comfort and security. If he takes the blue pill, he’ll continue to live in blissful ignorance.

>A more specialized use of the term describes a loose group of political activities with extremist leanings, particularly men’s rights activists and the alt-right movement. In this case, the name comes from the Reddit community The Red Pill, which was founded around the principle that it is men, rather than women, who are oppressed by society. This premise is considered the red pill of the community, regarded as the truth behind what they see as the myth of feminism.

The last paragraph is why people are surprised and worried that such a public figure is openly using the term, because it has been co-opted by the scummier side of the internet to hate on women.",488,2020-05-17 15:25:58,red pill,"What's up with Elon Musk's recent tweet ""take the red pill""?"

I created a completely new Instagram account, new email, everything. 

Didn’t follow anyone, didn’t post, just set my age  (18) and gender (female) and decided on an interest (Art) 

I immediately went into the discover, search page thing. And began scrolling. I scrolled, watched and liked as though I was an 18 year old girl interested in art (which I am so it was easy). 

Within an hour Instagram began suggesting me right wing conspiracy theories and red pill content. 

The first one I got was a right wing conspiracy theory. I watched for a few seconds until I logged what it was about and scrolled. I didn’t engage with this content past watching for a matter of seconds until I logged what it was. 
Despite fully engaging with almost exclusively art content. From the moment I watched that first video I was flooded with right wing content.

n3fle9c,1m18vhe,Fauxmoi,Global-Letter-4984,"Slightly off topic: Lauren is very intelligent and capable, but she has always used that massive intelligence to rationalize hateful right wing ideology and position herself as the rare woman who is above all of the typical misogynistic criticisms that the patriarchy throws at women, being “not like the other girls” in essence.

However, now that she is a single mom, a woman in her thirties (no longer “young”!), not a virgin or a wife, etc. she is no longer able to position herself as the typical conservative dream girl, and she’s choosing to brand herself as “not like the other girls” in a new way—by attempting to be more nuanced (victim-blaming herself?!), more complex (seeing both sides?!), more “empathetic” (to Andrew Tate?!!), and still not calling herself a feminist.

I went ahead and gave Lauren’s chapters a read, and I can tell she is still very much hungry for the approval of who she was indoctrinated her whole life to think is valuable: powerful, “intellectual”, white men. She thinks she can do that by being more centrist now.

Her new belief system doesn’t seem to be indicative of a true values shift. Rather, it is her clinging to the last vestiges of her conservative indoctrination (namely internalized misogyny and the centering of white maleness) while attempting to reconcile them with her own horrible experience with how right wing ideology treats women, ALL women no matter how “perfect” they might have seemed at the time.",23,2025-07-16 05:09:39,Andrew Tate,Retired conservative commentator Lauren Southern shares she was brutally raped by Andrew Tate in 2018

He’s a rank asshole online and outright offends people. It’s very difficult to talk shit about someone like Andrew Tate because hate him or love him he’s winning in life. Someone bragging about their riches has always pissed people off. He’s provocative and people obviously hate that. A lot of his opinions on women don’t help. Some of his lives are very cringe BUT if you’re being reasonable the whole human trafficker and rape thing is bogus. I’ve reviewed the cases because I wanted to make sure the man that I’m watching is in fact not a monster.

He’s beat everything despite that which some of your favorite celebrities who have more resources couldn’t do.

I remember several high school lectures about WW2 and Hitler’s rise to power and mentally responding with “Well someone had to save the economy.” Or other bullshit like that. 

I don’t know what saved me from going down that path. It could’ve been when my mom came out of the closet to me. It could’ve been my friend who declined going on a date, but said she still wanted to be friends, when I was truly desperate for real fucking friends.

For the ones hearing MAGA bullshit at home, this is central to the issue. If Trump did it, then it must work—never mind the actual results they see.

I’ve also heard them complain the girls they try this stupidity on aren’t “high quality,” so they didn’t want them anyway.

“Money making is a skill,” the website states. “We will teach you how to master it.”

On Thursday, the hackers made their actions known by flooding the course’s primary chatroom with emojis they uploaded while Tate was streaming an episode of his show “Emergency Meeting” on Rumble.

Unfortunately, they have learned that negative/cringe/appealing behaviors facilitate the attention and interventions that they crave considerably faster than healthier alternatives (as a society, this is our fault for sensationalizing instances of such unwanted behaviors).

I don't remember the ""real man"" or ""alpha male"" phenomenon being very prevalent 20 years ago when I was a young adult (online advertising hadn't taken over all services yet, and I didn't really read vanity magazines), but I can imagine how  it would have skewed my perception of what a ""man"" should be and behave like if I constantly saw influencers and advertisements about such everywhere.

**Primate studies challenge male-dominance norms**

To the point

Power relationships between males and females are less clear-cut than expected: **In most species, neither sex clearly dominates over the other.**

Evolutionary factors shape intersexual power: **Males have power when they can physically outcompete females, while females rely on different pathways to achieve power over males.**

New findings by researchers at the University of Montpellier, the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, and the German Primate Center in Göttingen resolve why male-female power asymmetries vary across primate societies. Bringing together detailed observations of male-female aggression from 253 populations across 121 primate species, the study shows that clear cut dominance by either sex is rare, and highlights the conditions under which females have become socially dominant over males in primate evolutionary history.",18,2025-07-08 02:13:31,alpha male,"Beyond the alpha male: Primate studies challenge male-dominance norms.

And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain

Will turn to me at midnight with a cry.

Nor knows what birds have vanished one by one,
Yet knows its boughs more silent than before:

I only know that summer sang in me

Men and women have different reproductive prerogatives. Women tend to be selective and men tend to need to compete for women simply due to their biology. This results in a rather large in-group bias of women onto women (so that they maintain selective pressure) and out-group bias of men onto women (so that these men can compete - given that nearly all men don't have leverage over women reproductively). Unfortunately this manifests in a bunch of women and men downplaying negative aspects of female nature and saying ""not all women"", giving a false perception of reality, and especially in a place such a reddit, these views will be more common than strict conversations amongst men you value. 

It's really key to ensure you're talking to someone who is aware of these biases or else you'll end up worse off by hearing what really is an echo of human nature and false perceptions for reproductive leverage rather than gaining greater knowledge on any true mechanism to better approach life.",0,2025-05-27 07:18:47,female nature,How did learning about female nature change you?

Sure, you could argue that historically women wouldn't have been allowed to do that work even if they'd wanted to. But at least here in the west, we've removed all of the artificial legal barriers as of \~50 years ago.

Since the civil rights legislation of the 60s, there have been no hard legal obstacles preventing women from pursuing these sorts of careers, and in fact it's been illegal for employers to discriminate in hiring on the basis of sex. So where are all the women in those fields?

Of course there are two caveats- I want to hear how you would define “traditional gender roles”, because I’m not saying that women are only good to be teachers and secretaries, or that women should always be deferential to their husbands . In my understanding, traditional gender roles only go as far as the walls of the house and concern the responsibilities of the spouses, no the rights or benefits of either party.

As for the second caveat, I do recognize that circumstances may require noncompliance with those traditional gender roles. I’m only speaking in generals, here.",3,2023-02-02 13:21:56,traditional gender roles,Would society be better off with traditional gender roles?
j6zdya5,10rxqvr,AskConservatives,[deleted],">Would society be better off with traditional gender roles?

It's hard to say.

First and foremost, traditional gender roles have always suffered from the fact that they play to average differences in temperament and interests between men and women without consideration for the overlap, so rigidly adhering to any system that defines people by group membership instead of as individuals is a recipe for problems.

Second, traditional gender roles made sense in agrarian society where every family was a self-employed business, because the woman's role running the household basically meant control over the bulk of the economic power in society while men held the bulk of political power. But industrial society pulled all of the economic power out of the individual household and pushed it into the factory, where men dominated the field as a function of their existing domination of the political realm. 

That's probably what actually screwed up the balance of power between men and women in society, because the previous system had stood for thousands of years and nobody really complained about it all that much until around the time of the industrial revolution. That's probably the time frame in which a change of direction would have been most useful.

I think what we probably should have done as a society would have been to place more value on keeping women in charge of the day-to-day operations of the factory. There would likely have been more empathy in the management, and therefore fewer conflicts between labor and the economic leadership. As industrialization expanded the reach of the male interest in things and ideas as automationndramatically inceeased human productivity, we could have proportionately expanded the power and influence of the female qualities of interest in people and organizational skills.",1,2023-02-02 15:30:44,traditional gender roles,Would society be better off with traditional gender roles?

m1a67se,1hann0l,AskMen,JJQuantum,"Women’s liberation beginning in the 1960’s, while wonderful, just and about time, left men confused.  Men were largely happy with the way things were.  I know that’s not right and I don’t think most men thought of it as subjugating women but, just for themselves, they were content, again mostly but certainly not completely.  

Women rightfully decided they wanted more out of life and so they said “I’m going to go do this and now you have to help out around the house and help more raising the kids.”  It was forced upon them.  Not only that but they wanted to be treated differently, again rightfully so.  Men don’t know what that entails because women don’t know what that entails.  

On the one hand you hear women wonder why men can’t leave them alone in public but then on the other hand you hear women complain that men don’t ask them out anymore.  Women are sometimes quick to call something sexual assault but then wonder why men won’t make the first move.  They act like they want gentlemen but then put those guys in the friend zone and date the assholes because dangerous is sexy.  They want men to do more housework but then criticize them for how they do it.  They want men to be more involved raising the kids but demand to have the final say in everything because they carried the baby for 9 months.  And so on.  

If women are this confused then there’s simply no way that men can figure out where they stand.  We are willing to step up but women can’t make up their minds to tell them exactly what they want.  Roles used to be well defined.  They aren’t now.  

Traditional gender roles are not even what they used to be.  I’ve never met a woman who thinks men should be in charge and women should simply follow their lead, even ones who claim to be trad wives.

f93qko8,e3l8pi,unpopularopinion,Oxyfool,"Oh my. There are so many things wrong with your statement, and I don’t have the information or knowledge to debate you on every account, but I will comment on your take on evolution.

Evolution does not encompass social structures at the level you are referring to. While the different sexes of our species have some biological traits that promote social structures that define gender roles, evolution does not hardwire us to function solely in patriarchal societies such as you describe. Here’s an example of the biological differences between the sexes that have likely been caused by evolution:

Females have slightly better colour vision than males, a trait that may have developed as an asset to foraging, allowing females to pick the ripest fruits and berries. They are also more perceptive of high pitched sounds, a trait that most likely developed so that mothers would be highly responsive to their babies needs, even at night while asleep. 

Males have more muscle mass potential and have higher testosterone levels that makes them somewhat better equipped for hunting and/or protecting their tribes. 

That being said, males can be just as nurturing as females, and females can be fiercer than males. These biological traits have been useful for the survival of our species, that is why they developed. 

Social structures are a different story. Humans (meaning sapiens) are very adaptable and susceptible to influence. This is why we have so many *very* different cultures. There are people who are cannibals, religious, nazis, patriarchal, matriarchal et cetera. There’s is no right or wrong answer here, it’s all circumstantial. A theory is that humans are actually born prematurely. Because of how our bodies have evolved (standing upright, with narrower birth-canals) human babies are less developed by the time of birth than say a cat. You cannot teach a cat to be like a mouse, but you can teach a human to be a nazi or a jewish devout person.

Society and our core beliefs and social structures are human constructs. They shift over time and cultures develop. This is why western cultures prize for example freedom, and equality andother cultures still impose caste systems. These cultures are formed by the people who belong to them. We have a long track record of using power to subjugate and oppress other group of people. This has often been very beneficial for some, and truly unfair for others. Black people being oppressed by white people, women by men, sunni by shia, muslims by christians, lower castes by higher castes. This is neither natural or unnatural, it’s in our nature to take advantage. But that doesn’t mean that the tables couldn’t be flipped. It’s a matter of circumstance.

Gender roles and the way they are passed on through generations do remind of the strict teacher and the beating ruler; there will come that child who grabs the ruler and throws it out of a window. 

But taking a step back. The idyllic notion of gender roles ignores the amount of violence they need to be kept in place. Psychological, verbal and at times physical warfare when folks stray from drawn paths; and perhaps they will fall in line, but they will do that carrying the pain that had them stick in line in the first place. 

The image of the humming wife, cooking bread and carrying laundry on her hips while her husband lovingly makes his way home to kiss her and the kids is a beautiful picture indeed. But it is a fantasy. It is utopic to even consider such a kind outcome when force and violence are used to have people fit in. So realistically, most past families always had an angry father, a depressed mother and scared kids.

m02h74m,1h4xkld,science,PogChampHS,"I see some commentators referencing that this goes against other well documented studies that conservatives tend to be happier than liberals. 

The key word here is adhere.

There is a difference between adhering to gender roles, and freely identifying with a specific gender role. Conservative men slip into masculine gender so easily that it doesn't feel like an identity, its simply being. There is no internal dissonance between themselves and what the world expects of them. If the world changes to clash with their identity, they fight back strongly to change the world  instead of themselves (ex. I have to make more money so I can continue to provide, I will vote for Trump to bring jobs. 

The suicide risk here comes from when the environment negates your ability to thrive under  traditional gender roles. Ex. Living in the rust belt, where jobs are disappearing, drug use is out of control, and there is no hope. Adopting a mindset of being open to help, understanding mental health, etc, is critical to surviving here. 

I think when the study uses the word ""adhere"", I feel like they are speaking really for men who don't fall easily into masculine gender roles. Unfortunately, despite society being relatively accepting of women  being able to adopt any role, be it breadwinner, or stay at home mom, men on the other hand don't have that freedom to choose. If you don't really care about status, or money, you still need to work because your viewed as a deadbeat, or a waste.

lcbv5pk,1dyypu7,science,mvea,"I’ve linked to the news release in the post above. In this comment, for those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: 

https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/1866-5888/a000348

From the linked article: 

Researchers have uncovered a link between managers’ narcissistic traits and their views on gender roles, shedding light on how personal attributes can impact leadership dynamics. The study, published in the Journal of Personnel Psychology, found that narcissistic admiration and narcissistic rivalry are differently associated with support for traditional gender roles. Additionally, the presence of a daughter can moderate these associations, particularly for managers high in narcissistic rivalry.

The researchers found that managers who scored high on narcissistic admiration tended to hold less traditional gender role attitudes. This finding aligns with the notion that individuals high in admiration are likely to promote themselves with progressive, innovative views to enhance their self-image.

But managers with high levels of narcissistic rivalry exhibited more traditional gender role attitudes. This could be due to their tendency to seek supremacy and maintain established power structures, which are often traditional in nature.

The findings provide evidence that narcissistic tendencies can “influence behaviors that support or hinder women in their careers and can thus contribute to the underrepresentation of women in leadership roles,” Stöcker and her colleagues explained.

The researchers also found that managers with at least one daughter showed less traditional gender role attitudes compared to those with only sons or no children. This supports the daughter effect hypothesis, suggesting that having a daughter can increase awareness of gender discrimination and promote more egalitarian views.",3,2024-07-09 03:08:24,traditional gender roles,"Managers with at least one daughter showed less traditional gender role attitudes compared to those with only sons or no children.

From the linked article: 

In a recent study published in the journal Sex Roles, researchers explored how women’s feelings of achievement and failure are influenced by their male partner’s orgasm during sexual encounters. The study revealed that women often perceive a man’s orgasm as an achievement of femininity, while the absence of a man’s orgasm can be seen as a failure of femininity, particularly for women who are more sensitive to traditional gender role expectations.

Although previous research has focused on how men perceive their female partner’s orgasm as a validation of their masculinity, there has been little investigation into how women experience their male partner’s orgasm—or the lack thereof. Given the societal scripts that often portray men’s orgasms as almost inevitable and biologically driven, the researchers wanted to investigate whether women also experience men’s orgasms as a form of personal success or failure, and if so, how this aligns with traditional gender roles.

The researchers also found that women with higher levels of sexual assertiveness felt more achievement when their male partner orgasmed and were more resilient against feelings of failure when he did not. This suggests that women who feel more empowered in their sexual agency may navigate these dynamics differently, potentially buffering against the negative emotions associated with a partner’s failure to orgasm.

Finally, women who attributed their partner’s orgasm (or lack thereof) to their own actions or sexual skills felt more intense feelings of achievement or failure depending on the outcome. This indicates that personal responsibility plays a significant role in how women experience their partner’s sexual satisfaction.",100,2024-08-23 14:16:34,traditional gender roles,"A new study suggests that women often perceive a man’s orgasm as an achievement of femininity, while the absence of a man’s orgasm can be seen as a failure of femininity, particularly for women who are more sensitive to traditional gender role expectations."

They manipulate people who subscribe to them into doing things that cause more people to subscribe to (potentially slightly different variations of) them. Like evolution.

In the case of traditional masculine gender roles, they work by instilling insecurities in men, causing them to have an emotional need to follow traditional masculine roles in order to feel ‘good enough’. Then those men will attack other men who do not follow these roles, because they are projecting things they have been trained to hate about themselves onto other men. These other, especially younger men will then develop the same insecurities as a result, and the cycle repeats. 

Because traditional gender roles play on insecurities to spread themselves, it can cause severe mental health issues for a lot of people. 

All of this happens with traditional female roles too, though the details and the symptoms are different. Also, it happens with a million other things.

Most of my closest female friends are, like me, unmarried, single-income households, grinding through capitalism, trying to build communal support systems without traditional family structures, and navigating the politics of sexuality and gender in our professional and personal lives. 

I really value your reflections, and I think it's refreshing to hear this authentic response from someone who has found their relationship to gender roles evolve. A couple of your points stand out to me:

""most of us have managed to escape the capitalist hamster wheel"" - Have you escaped the capitalist hamster wheel? Or did you just find a different relationship to the capitalist hamster wheel? A high earning man with a wife at home *is the capitalist hamster wheel* as it's been practiced for multiple generations (speaking as someone living in the United States, at least). You're not avoiding capitalism, you've just traded one way to participate in it for another. 

""sure, feminism is about being empowered to make the best choices for ourselves"" - I mean, sort of? Feminism is advocating for political, economic, and social equality among the sexes. I don't want to split hairs over what personal choices and actions are feminist or not, but to your point of, ""how is it that nearly all of us chose *this""...* is it at all possible that so many people, including your social circle, chose the traditional gender roles because it's easier to conform to the societal blueprint? 

It's also very clear to me that you and your friends *do labor* as full or part-time stay-at-home moms*.* It is just not labor that is paid through wages or salary. Feminist theory (some, not all) has long argued that this labor deserves protections, compensation, and dignity, that shouldn't just be dependent on whether or not a husband chooses to offer it. 

To be clear, I'm not saying your choice is wrong, anti-feminist or requires apologizing. I have no right to judge you, and I hope it's plain that I'm not writing this as a condemnation. No personal choice is ever so simple as being ""right"" or ""wrong"" based on a single lens, such as feminism.

This finding underscores the pressure women might feel to accommodate their partners’ desires, potentially at the expense of their own.

I think this paragraph, and truly the article, makes a mistake by simply one-offing this particular statement and overall sentiment as insignificant because (ironically) the study itself supports gendered views of sexual gendering. 

Males are already pigeonholed into the state of being ""sexual beings"" with study ""confirming this"" but if gender roles play a part then by definition being male and ""a man"" means you have to have a higher sexual desire which in turn suggests that it is a vicious cycle. It is possible that males and females have similar sexual desires but due to gender roles demanding that males be the sexual aggressors to begin with. 

I am not saying that there is no difference but I find that the identification of the trait and the hand waving towards is are somewhat synonymous with a failure to understand the human nature in general: An established belief, with an established dogma, skews scientific research and whilst science isn't dogma there's nothing that stops social dogma from influencing scientific hypotheses.",79,2024-03-09 09:56:51,traditional gender roles,"Men and women who endorse traditional gender roles report lower levels of sexual desire in their relationships.

>**”As a sex therapist, I am very concerned about the potential trauma individuals may experience in the context of obligatory sex in their relationship, even when there is no clear aggressor,” said study author Ateret Gewirtz-Meydan, an associate professor and the director of the Science of Sex Lab at the University of Haifa. “This concern is rooted in the understanding that challenges related to sexual dynamics within conservative committed relationships, particularly obligatory sex, can lead to significant and lasting consequences, encompassing psychological and emotional trauma.”**

> “The study suggests that gender roles and beliefs about traditional gender norms can significantly influence individuals’ sexual desire and the frequency of sexual activity in committed relationships,” Gewirtz-Meydan told PsyPost. “Men with low support for traditional gender roles may prioritize mutual satisfaction, while women with high support for traditional roles may perceive sex more as a duty than an expression of personal desire. The findings highlight the need to challenge societal norms for more equitable sexual dynamics in relationships.

>”As a sex therapist, I think therapists should encourage and actively promote shared decision-making in sexual activities. This recommendation extends to committed romantic long-term relationships, emphasizing the significance of mutual consent and equal participation. Such an approach empowers individuals to navigate their sexual experiences in alignment with their personal desires and preferences.”

The big hang-up here is that some couples strategize for mismatched libidos which is just an inevitability when in a long-term sexual relationship. I don't see how there is more potential for trauma doing this than to avoid sex from a partner. The study questionnaire asks about desire but not quality. If traditional couples are having more sex and it boosts the relationship the desire for that sex may be lower in one or both but that doesn't change the positive outcomes that we know come from better intimacy and better relationship quality.

&#x200B;

>Male participants reported significantly higher levels of sexual desire and attraction to their partner compared to female participants. Moreover, men also reported engaging in sexual activities with their partners more frequently than women did. **This finding aligns with traditional perceptions and stereotypes** that suggest men typically exhibit a higher sexual drive than women.

I have no problem with a spectrum of behaviors or relationship practices being labeled traditional or conservative but the comparison here isn't traditional vs non traditional its women's desire vs men's.  This result is cited as being the norm and correct me if I'm wrong but if it's an independent variable this holds true even for men with low support of traditional gender roles. So male libido is a symptom of support for traditional gender roles?

&#x200B;

>This study suggests that men with low support for traditional gender roles showed a stronger alignment between their own and their partner’s sexual needs, and women with high support for traditional gender roles relied more on their partner’s sexual desire. These findings suggest that men’s sexual desires have a prominent role in determining the frequency of sexual activity, especially in conservative relationships.

Im comfortable with this conclusion but the hyperfocus on desire along with the established sexual differences between men and women make it less useful as an indicator of which value set is most beneficial to relationship quality. The conclusion is that low support for traditional gender roles increases desire but that doesn't explain why this type of relationship gives people higher sex drives but less sex.

When women entered the workforce and started having their own careers, things needed to be revamped.

No.

A household has chores and things to fix and other minutiae to keep up with. 

If both people work, those things need to be split equally. 

Men tend to miss the mental load that women more often bear, thinking that the split is equal/equitable when it’s not. 

If you take on the task of replacing a tire, then what’s important is that you get it done. You can change it yourself or pay someone, but don’t make your spouse figure out what kind of tire, and call to see how much it is, and schedule getting it done, etc. That puts the mental load on the spouse.  

Dishes are similar— if you’re doing dishes, don’t wait until your spouse tells you to do them. Just get them done. Or pay a maid. But get them done in a way your spouse is not having to mentally put it on their own plate. 

One half of a couple might think they do a lot with grocery shopping — but if all you do is go buy the groceries when you’re told from a list, you didn’t do most of that work.  The person who realized you needed groceries and made a list did a significant portion.

(Not in the “Trad Wife” sense that’s popular in social media and has become almost a romanticized caricature of the concept, though)

The “fixing things” part of your question threw me off a bit. Because you seem to be going back to referencing your parents and their abilities as if they were a reason for how you behave now at 40+ when I think it is mostly inconsequential - particularly at this age. 
AND, “fixing things” is such a minute part of traditional gender roles. 

This is just an anecdote, but my mother and grandmother both LOATHED cooking, so they hardly ever did. (I think I remember my mom cooking twice my entire childhood.) and, unsurprisingly I was never taught to as much as boil water. 

However, when I moved out I taught myself. And now it’s one of my favorite things to do. 

So, if traditional gender roles is something important to you, and you view “fixing things” as an integral part to that, I suggest that you take the steps to teach yourself those skills.

While yes, you can’t demand the traditional patriarchal view of femininity without traditional gender roles, or without you yourself adhering to these roles as well - I also think masculinity and femininity both go beyond traditional gender roles and both can exist without the patriarchal sphere that limits what each means. Femininity, as an example, shouldn’t mean “subservient support pieces who stay home and raise the kids” - that’s certainly a version of it, but the many rebellious and boundary pushing female led movements, groups and individuals were also feminine. Even in mythology (which, while isn’t based in history - it is based in psychological history, ie. how people interacted with the world around them and how culture is formed), there are many feminine figures who aren’t subservient.

kyp5s06,1byyg12,ukpolitics,kriptonicx,"Surely it's kinda obvious why this is happening? Men and women are not the same and are fundamentally driven by different desires which require different political solutions.

Men like the idea of traditional gender roles because men (generally speaking) are dumb. We seek women that look nice, that make us feel wanted and that we can protect and provide for. Having a beautiful wife, who loves you enough to have your children and cook you dinner because she appreciates that you bring in a decent income is what practically every straight guy desires.

Women don't necessarily want the inverse of this though and that's where the conflict happens. Women don't aspire to look pretty for men or be good house wives, this is just something women just historically had to do if they cared about getting the things they wanted from life since most of these things depended on a women's ability to find and keep a man who could provide her the life she desired.

Today women have options and the government provides safety in the place of fathers and husbands. A man really only offers value to a women today if he earns significantly more money or has significant more social value. I mean  why would any women today submit herself to a man earning an average wage when she could get that herself? He's probably need to have some social clout or being very attractive. And beyond financial considerations she has no need a settle for a for purely for children or safety.

For women the state is a liberator, but for average men it's often a competitor.

I suspect some of this is also related to women being less comfortable with social conflict and therefore less likely to express their true opinions. I've found it's quite hard to find women that will take controversial positions generally (left or right) in my experience. It's far more easy to find men at the far extremes of politics and it just so happens that today culture is more socially tolerant of left-wing views than right-wing views. A women saying she supports labour isn't going to receive any backlash for her opinion, but if she said she was voting Tory or didn't like mass migration I'd probably spit in her eye. I suspect for this reason a lot of women simply conform to social norms and avoid views that could risk conflict. Men the other hand are probably not worried about expressing that they don't agree with mass migration to me, they might even find it funny take a position like this provoke me.
