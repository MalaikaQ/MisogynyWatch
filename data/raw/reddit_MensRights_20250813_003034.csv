This begs the question, how did we loose sight of men and boys a human beings, entitled to the same rights and protections as women and girls? 

Sadly, the answer is that men and boys have never been considered as equal beneficiaries of human rights, compared to women and girls. Our social fabric has depended on the repeated callous disregard for men and boys as free individuals, and their enlistment as disposable pawns to be sacrificed for the benefit of others. 

This may be why the benificance of masculinity is so frequently described in terms of the benefits or harms it provides to the community in general, and in particular, to women and girls.

This excellent article explains how government, law/policy makers and academia fail to include men and boys in considerations of human rights in New Zealand.

🚨🚨 To Everyone Affected by AWDTSG or Safe Tea: Here’s How to Fight Back 🚨🚨 If you've already sent an email—send it again. If you haven’t, now is the time

We’re done playing this insane game. These apps are doing real harm. The fastest way to shut them down is **cutting off their payment processors**.

---

### 🧨 The Harm These Apps Cause:

* **Defamation & Harassment**: AWDTSG (6M users) and Safe Tea (\$1.6M ARR) allow people to post **anonymous, unverified information** that ruins lives—careers shattered, mental health devastated, stalkers enabled.

* **Privacy Violations**: These apps **track sensitive user data** without proper consent—violating Apple’s **Guideline 5.1** and Google’s privacy terms.

* **Mental Health Crises**: Victims face public shaming, job loss, stalking, and anxiety. These platforms profit while real people suffer.

---

### 💥 Why Target Payment Processors?

Without access to **Stripe, PayPal**, and other payment services, these apps **can’t function**. Once payments are blocked, app stores are more likely to **delist them** entirely—cutting off future users and revenue.

---

### 🎯 Who to Email:

> You don’t need to write a long essay. Just clearly explain how the apps are enabling harassment and defamation, violating privacy, and causing mental distress. Demand action.

n6drp36,1m8o9uq,MensRights,_WutzInAName_,"Info about a class action lawsuit against Tea below, from ZealousidealLet234:

Yes—a man can bring a lawsuit even if he doesn’t yet know whether he’s been posted, and in fact, the very fact that men are categorically excluded from access is itself a legally actionable harm.

Here’s why.

⸻

1.	⁠Exclusion Alone Creates Standing

Even if a man hasn’t confirmed whether he was “doxxed,” the denial of access based on sex—while allowing women to use the app freely—is itself: •	Gender discrimination under state civil rights laws (like California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act, which applies to all businesses, including apps). •	A deprivation of equal access to a commercial service, which courts increasingly recognize as a harm in itself (especially when paired with reputational risk).

That means any man could sue on the grounds that he is denied the ability to monitor, defend, or correct information posted about him.

⸻

2. The Catch-22 Actually Strengthens the Case

The app’s design—allowing women to post names, photos, and accusations while denying men the ability to know, verify, or respond—could be argued as: •	A due process and fairness violation (in civil contexts, not constitutional, but as a principle in consumer protection claims). •	An inherently discriminatory business practice because it creates a closed ecosystem where only one gender can participate, while the other is targeted.

This also bolsters arguments for injunctive relief (a court order to shut down or modify the app) even before damages are proven.

⸻

3. How a Plaintiff Could Proceed

There are two main routes:

A. Individual Lawsuit (Civil Rights/Consumer Protection)

A single man (even one who doesn’t know if he’s posted) could sue on the basis of: 1.	Being categorically denied access due to gender. 2.	The foreseeable risk of reputational harm because he cannot monitor or defend himself. 3.	Apple’s participation (hosting and profiting despite the discrimination).

B. Class Action

Because every man is excluded by design, attorneys could file a class action on behalf of all men denied access, seeking: •	Statutory damages (many civil rights statutes provide automatic damages per violation), •	An injunction forcing Apple to remove or alter the app, •	Potential punitive damages if the conduct is deemed reckless or exploitative.

⸻

4. How Apple Becomes Liable

Normally, Apple could hide behind Section 230. But: •	Section 230 does not cover civil rights claims, unfair business practices, or Apple’s own decision to distribute a discriminatory app. •	Apple profits directly (via App Store fees) and has developer policies explicitly banning apps that promote harassment or discrimination, so knowingly hosting this app could be framed as negligence or willful misconduct.

⸻

5. So, Can “Any Man” Sue?

Yes. Even without proof that he’s posted: •	The denial of equal access is enough to establish standing. •	The risk of reputational harm (since he cannot even check or appeal posts about him) strengthens the case for injunctive relief. •	If discovery later reveals specific doxxing or defamation, that can add damages claims.",2,2025-08-01 10:10:13,False,Tea App Megathread,225,2025-07-24 20:06:55,179,,,,,,[]

Collects ID photos, geolocation, device identifiers, IP addresses, and Face ID usage.

No definition of how long ""temporary"" means, or what security controls are in place before deletion. This is a biometric privacy red flag.

They share personal information for advertising and marketing purposes, something you must opt OUT of (through settings, email? not sure). Also allows data sharing for ""business deals,"" and with ""banking partners  
 under ""credit card association rules.""

Their supposed data aggregation claims are weak. Mentions data may be anonymized ""before sharing,"" but offers no clear anonymization standard. Pseudonymized data can often be re-identified, especially when it includes location, device, or behavioral signals.

And the policy offers a takedown process only to registered users (i.e., women posting content). Men, the subjects, aren't given rights under this framework.

Women May behave more aggressively towards women that they perceive as beautiful 
https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/3826209?utm_source=chatgpt.com

Most relevant to my life is the body of research which shows that women are less likely to hire women that they think are pretty. One example is “Don’t hate me because I’m beautiful: Anti-attractiveness bias in organizational evaluation and decision making” by Agthe, Spörrle, and Maner was published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology in 2010 .

This has actually led me to personally not wear makeup and kind of muss myself up a bit for job interviews where I know that the interviewer is a woman.

I've also personally kind of subjectively noticed that it seems like in particular nerd women really really don't like other nerd women who are a conventional by attractive standards. In communities like tabletop gaming, larping, fandoms, the people who were really sidelining certain women in the community weren't so much men but other women who seemed to dislike that so-and-so wasn't really fitting the image of what a nerd girl looks like. I don't think this is so much true now as it was maybe 10- 20 years ago, but it was something that really stood out to me: whoever was the stereotypically pretty and feminine women at the LARP was always getting open hostility from other women, but not necessarily from guys.",19,2025-08-12 18:21:25,False,The Female Jealousy Epidemic,142,2025-08-12 16:41:03,16,,,,,,[]

Then he continues to do this with the women he dates for years and women are doing the same with him. It’s called dating. Until one day he finds one he falls in love with, who happens to be really attractive. They’re traveling to beautiful places, they get married, they buy a home, they start a family. 

Years go by, and one night one of the women who got passed is sitting alone in her house full of cats, miserable because she’s still single and drowning her misery in a bottle of wine, and she hears about these groups and the Tea app. Who do you think she’d going to look up or post about? All of her exes. Oh shit she found Brad from college and other girls already said he’s a narcissist and abusive even though nothing could be further from the truth. Suddenly he’s got a whole gang of women dragging him that he went on two dates with years ago, and it gets back to his hot wife. Now he’s having marital problems and maybe getting a divorce, all because these monsters are jealous of Brad and his hot wife.",13,2025-08-12 18:50:14,False,The Female Jealousy Epidemic,142,2025-08-12 16:41:03,16,,,,,,[]

The more problems she creates and the more boundaries she pushes, the more vulnerable and less accountable she is for her actions. 

Supposedly she found this attractive male psychiatrist, who’s the same age, by accident after randomly selecting the first google result. She went in there and figured any boundaries she pushed were his responsibility, even though she’s explaining how aware of these boundaries she was from the first encounter. She starts calling him by his first name right away as if he broke her trust by letting her. He shouldn’t have been attractive, her age, and instead of listening to her talk about her mental health, the mental health professional should have told her it was inappropriate. She just assumes he’s interested and there’s a conflict of interest because he’s hot and therefore leading her on. 

This is some main character shit. She even thinks the therapist is more interested in hearing about her life than doing her job of acting like she’s interested in hearing about her life.

n8f1qf3,1morpay,MensRights,Readshirt,"Not a terrible statement, surprised to see this from Movember. Reads like it was given a run through by AI to ensure ""balance"".

I am surprised that they come relatively close to acknowledging that what they initially euphemise as ""reputational precarity"" is actually a form of violence. It absolutely is, it's often a form of*sexual* violence, and an incredibly serious one. 

At the same point in the text they say that men ""face stereotypes"" while women have ""legitimate concerns"" though - immediately weakening any semblance of pro-male advocacy. The statement has the same energy as ""men get hurt feelings, women get hurt"" etc. It just isn't true.

They go on to say the apps cause young men to ""internalise a narrative"" about being persecuted by women, and when have their ""fears about male retaliation confirmed"". This is a good example of how poor Movember's advocacy is. Men aren't internalising a narrative - the Tea App is direct evidence of the application of false and unverifiable claims en masse to attempt to violently destroy the lives of men. Creating a reciprocal app isn't ""male retaliation"", it's applying ""if you can do it, we can do it"" logic. Retaliation contextually here implies some kind of undue punishment, but that's not what it is. It's a legitimate, proportionate response to an opening salvo of actual violence that was initiated by women.

And the solution at the end seems to place responsibility, unsurprisingly, on men. We need to ""step out of the retaliation cycle"" and move towards building safety and trust. No, I think we need to recognise the harm and actual violence created by the initial app and have accountability and ""building trust and safety"" about that. That would stop the ""retaliation cycle"" before it begins, but unfortunately relies on acknowledging that women can be at fault and should be accountable and responsible for their own behaviour, and it seems we're not quite there yet...

Remains to be seen if they'll actually take any kind of action or do any true advocacy, and that being *for men*, not a half hearted ""both sides"" approach that ends up diluting and devaluing whatever they did attempt in terms of helping men. But if this was a first step from someone who eventually wants to say more but had to hammer this statement through overzealous, pro feminist narrative checks and reviews, I say well done.

n8ew1je,1morpay,MensRights,Human_Way_6703,"Here’s the thing- in my city there are 60k women in AWDTSG and only 1k in the men’s group. When men post anonymously, they immediately get clowned for it, especially if they haven’t dated her yet and are just looking for “tea.” Usually the reaction is, “just go on a date with her and see if you like her” etc. At this point Tea has way, way more users than TeaOnHer and it’s probably going to remain that way.

n8ee3jt,1mo8p36,MensRights,pancakecel,"I mean personally, I can say that it was kind of frustrating. 

A few years back there was this male birth control shot being tested that worked a lot like the hormonal options women take. It was super effective, but the guys in the trial started dropping out because of side effects like mood swings, acne, weight gain, and lowered libido (you know, the same stuff women have been dealing with on the pill for decades???) The researchers actually stopped the study early. 

It was frustrating the idea that the same symptoms which women have dealt with for decades were considered a deal breaker for men. That being said, I don't think misogyny or patriarchy is the only thing at play here.

There's a lot of other research that suggests that men in general are more hesitant to seek out preventive medicine such as routine check-ups, screenings or vaccinations unless ''there's already a problem"". So the idea that men would be unwilling to tolerate symptoms associated with a preventative injection kind of just seems to fit into the constellation of what's going on with men's health to begin with. 

Also I think it's valuable to think about how some of those side effects might square differently with men's self-image than women self-image. For example lower libido. A woman with lower libido might not experience the same self-image hit as a man with lower libido, due to a lot of societal narratives about men being ''always wanting it'' and that being wrapped up in the idea of what it means to be a man.

Also, if you're a woman dealing with low libido, let's say that means you don't get dilated when it's time to have sex. That sucks, but you're still physically capable of having sex. It hurts, but it can still happen. Whereas if you're a man and you can't get an erection, no sex. 

Also weight gain might be more of a deal breaker for men because they are more likely to do jobs which require them to be physically fit than women. Obviously there's a lot of women who do jobs like that, but there's a larger share of men who do.",1,2025-08-12 19:15:08,False,Progress in the development of a male contraceptive pill,118,2025-08-12 06:26:17,39,,,,,,[]

n8ddh4g,1mo8p36,MensRights,ApprehensiveMail8,"Efficacy trials are a major problem for male contraception since... well, who exactly are you going to get to test this?

The market for male birth control would mostly be couples who want it as a backup  to female birth control they are already using and single men who have no idea if their partners are using birth control. Perhaps some married men who are currently relying on condoms or vasectomy but would like to switch.

The problem is none of those groups can reliably *test*  a male birth control.

The couple using it as backup aren't fertile to begin with and the single guy might not even get laid during the trial period. If he does, there's no guarantee his partner(s) would *tell him* if they got pregnant so he can't report that back to the researchers.

You can't use married guys who are dissatisfied with condoms or want a vasectomy reversal since... well, they'd be divorced guys as soon as they told their wives they are switching to an experimental method. At best, they'd be looking at a dead bedroom or a wife using her own birth control rather than risking it.

So... really, you have to use guys whose wives *want to get pregnant* and they are using the experimental birth control on the DL.

That may not be the target market, but it's the only group who can actually find out if a male birth control would actually work.

n8e2tlu,1mo8p36,MensRights,ApprehensiveMail8,"Adherence to sperm testing on a regular basis would almost certainly be considered part of the birth control itself.

This is how it already works with vasectomies. A vasectomy is not technically complete until the patient has gotten an all clear on two sperm tests performed months after the procedure (which are expensive and the financial responsibility of the patient).

This does two things:

1) It effectively shields the provider from ""wrongful life"" liability because most men don't get the sperm testing done and then it's your fault for not getting the testing done. If you *do* get the testing done, and it shows you still have sperm, then it's your fault if you get someone pregnant because you knew you still had sperm and should have been using other birth control.

2) It makes the ""pearl index"" efficiency of vasectomies very high. Because if you require every participant in your study to pass two tests proving they are infertile before they are eligible to participate, there won't be a lot of unexpected pregnancies.

---

Both of these things would be desired for any male birth control provider.

The manufacturer would not want to be liable for accidental pregnancies, or have them count against the ""pearl index"" of the method, so they would require the user get regular sperm testing.

Only... if it's reversible then you couldn't stop at just two. You would need monthly checks for as long as you are using the method to prove your sperm count hasn't rebounded.

It's clearly not about what's right, just like school, it's all about what's cool. Women are getting away with it and it seems like that's what these people want. Instead of boys having healthy relationships with their peers, apparently the girls will still date the grown men and the teachers will swoop in and get the boys... Just predatory shit everywhere.

n8baggm,1mnjitu,MensRights,mggrath-it,">Between 1999 and 2010, while the news and popular culture talked about to catch a predator

The news and popular culture also had 18 birthday counters for female celebs, which was met with little backlash. It was in media outlets, websites, etc, particularly during the 90s and early 2000s + the Girls Gone Wild! craze. We also had r/ jail bait, sexualization of Angie Verona, who was the most searched teen on the internet. But the 2000s also had middle aged women wooing and cheering 16/17 year old Taylor Lautner during the Twilight craze. 15 year old Justin Bieber sexualized by men and women, and Harry Styles at 16 sexualized by women and then by 17 dating older women 10+ years older, but then we also had Demi Lovato at 17 dating an older man.

>Women have for a long time gone after younger men with impunity, and no one cares. But a movie star dates a 24 year old and he’s a pervert.

This isn't really true. Historically, women dating or going after younger adult men were judged more than men dating or going after younger adult women. Women were judged for defying gender roles, seen as desperate. Men, especially in Hollywood, were generally celebrated. In non-famous couples, If the age gap was large enough or the man was unattractive enough he'd be somewhat shamed for dating younger women. However, the younger woman was more than likely judged and shamed more than the older man, often called gold-diggers or having daddy issues.

There's, however, been a change over the last 10 years or so, due to greater awareness around predatory behaviors, people talking about power imbalance, power dynamics, brain development, etc. People, especially on social media, have shamed (called predators, creeps, etc) older men dating younger women e.g. Leo Dicaprio, Zach Braff, Zack Bia, Henry Cavill, Chris Evans, etc. However, women haven’t been immune to being labeled predatory when they date or chase younger adult men. People have shamed Sam Taylor Johnson for being married to a much younger man, Aaron Taylor Johnson. People have shamed Kate Beckinsale for routinely dating younger men. Jennifer Lawrence got backlash for her movie No Hard Feelings. Bonnie Blue's been labelled a predator for her ""barely legal"" stunts.

The actual double standard that's against men is when men go after underaged girls. Men, since at least the  1970s, have been judged more harshly for going after underage girls than women going after underage boys. Research and anecdotes regularly confirm this. Here's the nuance though: Research and anecdotes show underage female victims are either seen as seductresses or victims. Underage male victims are either seen as lucky and willing or victims.

Too often I see women saying ""no one says anything to men going after barely legal women"", or men saying ""no one says anything to women dating younger men"" - or I'll see things like ""girls are raised from birth to be teen seductresses"", ignoring the evidence where they've also been portrayed routinely as victims, or people saying ""no one cares about male victims"", even though there's been a bigger increase in people caring about male victims over the years.

You’re correct on one crucial point, just as people don’t choose their sexual orientation, pedophiles don’t choose their attraction to children. The difference is that acting on that attraction is immoral and criminal since children cannot give consent unlike gays or lesbians, which is exactly why a mature society should focus on prevention. That means destigmatizing the condition enough for those who haven’t offended to seek psychological help without fear of being lynched socially. Suppressing discussion and treating it as an untouchable taboo only drives it underground, making it harder to prevent abuse and, in practice, increasing the number of victims.

This is not complicated logic. But here’s where you misjudge the opposition, you’re assuming the average online redditor is capable of following basic cause and effect reasoning. They’re not.

You may have a disorder but you are still accountable for your actions. And what if his lack of remorse after killing that person triggers an angry reaction from the victim's family?

Got a bunch of people fired and even today studios still fire actors if they just get an allegation. Doesn't even have to be true.  


They say men hating women is systemic. Yet if you look at old traditional stuff it's always women being prioritised and protected. Women and children first, women exempt from the horror of war, chivalry is just putting her on a pedestal, dating/marriage life is essentially just ""give into her"" for men (happy wife happy life nonsense)


Systemically I would argue they care too much about women. Even when an article came out saying 1 in 4 homeless are womem everyone cried patriarchy ignoring that means 3 in 4 homeless were men. How is that a patriarchy?


They are always talking about women's health, got a whole month to themselves, women viewers are prioritised and media depictions of women are treated more gently and with respect.

They're born into social acceptance, are never losers but rather victims and they are afraid of social exile because they don't have to prove themselves the way men do,- they have inherent value.  
And since they are born into the social cabal, they're naturally trained in social maneuvering and compete harshly with one another, but also find solace in bonding over the blaming of what has been construed as the common enemy: Men.  
They hate the humanization of men because men are the sacrificial kindling that turns the wheels of society, and they understand that masculinity is involuntary.  
If you give Men the option of being people, there will be no ""real men"" left, no hordes of suckers with a few anti-social winners of top they can pick and exploit.  
  
If you treat her like an equal she will deem you unworthy, she wants a ""professional"" relationship where she's the little lady and you're the resource generator that silently know what the deal is and won't upset the dynamic. It's not that you're ""threatened"" by her ""independence"", it's that you know that if you deviate from your assigned role, she will be disgusted by you.   
She wants to believe that your masculinity is not an act, that you're ""just like that"", while complaining that masculinity is toxic and that men need to be less manly (virtue signaling, declaring herself as a moral authority).  
It's kind of like the male version of body positivity.  
Be less manly so you disqualify yourself from the race.  
  
These are unnuanced statements on my part, but i do think they are generally right.  
Women don't need special programs, their lives are already great.  
""Mye vil ha mer"", ""much wants more"".  
Understanding is important, and helps alleviate resentment, you still have to play, and if you do so successfully life can be tolerable. Everything we're told is a lie, and being upset by it makes life worse.  
It's a power game and if you get good your life improves, it doesn't necessitate you liking all aspects of it.  
Rejecting power is no good, you have to just get better at playing and learning to avoid letting other people have power over you, power is choice, and being upset at immorality is just your naivety dying.  
Time for rebirth.  
The difference between hateful slave and weak lord is merely the choice of playing, actively living your life,- it's a psychological reframing that empowers you.  
Better to be a disgruntled lord than a resentful slave, both evil and tragedy will haunt you forever regardless, choose to play, choose to live.

There are also no widespread gender-targeted violence against women being supported by political or legal systems either, so not sure where this argument is even coming from. It's very delusional. No political or legal party would really survive that kind of backlash, and society is far more attuned to misogyny than it is to misandry.

  
Women also don't really need to have official political/legal support to organize widespread gender-targeted violence against men. Social media is full of it. I guess the fact that these types of posts are often ignored or not taken down by the companies who provide those social media services does count as legal support.

n892akq,1mnwe19,MensRights,World-Three,"I think they're also against what the idea implied to men... 


Feminism was defined to me as rights and choice for women, equality of opportunity. As a man I am fine with that, but my brain did a Spider-Man and said great power comes with great responsibility. But that's not what happened.


Typically, if you do something you don't like every day, someone picking up the slack makes you appreciate them. So I assumed completely that a bunch of women going to work and learning to do a few male oriented things was going to make men and women bond like crazy. And when it was new, it DID. You would also, like parents do, hope that the participation in the same act would create more appreciation for the sacrifices they make to give them the lives they had. 


That, DIDN'T happen... 


The group never seemed to realize that men weren't ever doing it for themselves. Raised from childhood to stand up, create a foundation, to have shelter, a car, a job, unconditional love, for someone else. These women who spend the same amount of time at work but little to none of the money on someone else love it because it's just profit. I think men would love the situation too if they just kept all the money they made and bought nice outfits to be attractive and saved the rest. But they typically have a chip on their shoulder because they're doing it for someone else, usually someone they haven't ever seen or isn't even sure exists.


It's a complete mismatch. Money for love. And because you can't really buy love, they're buying the opportunity to be and stay loved... Men are basically small time salesmen. Going door to door, pitching their product, themselves, but when you're not interested in buying anything, or ads in general, even the best products get rejected. 


If you ever tried to start a business it's typically the most expensive thing you'll ever have to do. And all men are basically tasked with doing that just to be potentially loved. Feminism hasn't even brushed up with that concept and it's something I genuinely hoped it would have done. ",14,2025-08-12 00:36:12,False,"It often feels like the entire world is against this idea, and being a MRA is a guaranteed martyr?",85,2025-08-11 19:11:20,80,,,,,,[]

Women can be the one to check outside of the camping tent to see if there's an animal.  Why should I have to get hurt or die?  Would they even care if I died or would they just find another disposable man?


I don't have to destroy my body and my mind for someone who hates me and doesn't care about me.  Why should I sacrifice myself for someone who is ungrateful and sees me as a dog (golden retriever?) to do things?


I decided I like equality.  I don't want to sacrifice myself for people who don't give a shit about me and look down on me.

n892e48,1mnwe19,MensRights,EmirikolWoker,"I'm in the UK. Here are some rights that women have and men lack: 
  
* Presumed custody of children in the case of divorce. This was exacerbated by the Tender Years Doctrine, spearheaded by first-wave feminist Caroline Norton, and perpetuated by modern feminists through lobbying groups' efforts against rebuttable presumed shared custody. 
  
* Seperation of consent to sex from consent to parenthood and the responsibilities thereof, [even if the conception came about through statutory rape of the father](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/). I go [into greater detail here](https://old.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/10dvooq/what_are_examples_of_women_being_allowed_to_be/j4pa67d/).
  
* Bodily integrity (i.e., genital mutilation. For girls its a violation of international law; for men it's at best unusual but tolerable, and at worst actively campaigned for as an eroneous means of combating AIDS).
  
*  Immunity from accusations of rape. Rape requires the perpetrator to have a penis (and in the UK, only a cisgendered man can commit it), so when women engage in nonconsentual sex with men, he is more likely to be charged than she is. This is mainly the work of Feminist researcher Mary Koss, from whom feminists get the eroneous 1-in-4 statistic. And if a woman gets pregnant from raping a man (or boy), she can sue her rape victim for child support.
  
Obviously some of these would be best reformed by giving men rights (bodily integrity, for instance), while some would be better served by removing womens' privileges (immunity from accusations of rape). Equal treatment, that's all that's required.
  
If we want to go to Those Places Over There, the ones that feminists like to point to when they're on the ropes and don't mind implying that brown people are less moral than white people, we see the same things: they mutilate the genitals of girls Over There? They do it to boys too, and that's still legal, just like Over Here. A man can force sex on his wife Over There and it's not rape unless XYZ? A woman Over There can force sex on *anyone* and it's not considered rape *at all*, just like Over Here.

Given your track record, that remains to be seen.
  
> What is your ideal world and how do we achieve said world? I.e regarding equality 

Equal legal rights, equal legal responsibilities, equal accountability. Where this is not possible (because a ""perfect world"" is impossible), responsibilities proportional with rights, and resources allocated proportionally with difficulties.
  
A good start would be to take the ideology out of law - that means, for instance, degendering crimes like rape and domestic violence, treating men and women the same in the eyes of the law (aside: if we sentenced men with the same leniency as we sentence women who commit the same crimes, 5:6 prisoners wouldn't be in prison). 
  
It would mean that we'd be able to see issues like prison being all-but-abolished for women only and over 90% of the prison population being male as a mens rights issue, discrimination against men for being men, rather than ""women are oppressed by being kept from prison"", or ""men are just more criminal"". Where non-white people are disproportionately represented in the US prison population, we have no trouble identifying that they face discrimination in the System for their race; where women are a tiny minority of the prison population, we are happy to ascribe that to maleness being criminal. [And that's not the only gap where gender disparity outweighs race disparity](https://old.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1m39lfp/mens_rights_activists_and_feminists_want_the_same/n4d5fhe/?context=3).
  
Protecting due process is a big deal. Currently, especially in trials for sex crimes, [due process rights are eroded in favour of ""increasing successful convictions""](https://www.scottishlegal.com/articles/rape-shield-laws-infringe-right-to-a-fair-trial?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAYnJpZBEwS0xHTGVnME1rS21BRkJCRgEeZztVKIeb4tbs1Sb2DkKXmhDfl1BJMyyjWH8c-cnYHJnlW8TsLdX3sywq3KY_aem_4QxDr91XmwS4A-s2wItykg) (which frames acquittals as failure to convict rather than the accused being Innocent Until Proven Guilty), meaning that people are being [placed in literal torture-cages](https://news.stv.tv/scotland/hmp-perth-inmates-living-in-cramped-conditions-at-scotlands-oldest-prison-inspection-reveals?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAYnJpZBEwS0xHTGVnME1rS21BRkJCRgEePXo3gEj3Dl8vAbv4cv1sHVxKXPr4kdsteDxq1PhjbTgjF1znl1iDyIkvOy4_aem_ks7o9I8GysPSindfLyxlaA) in many cases while being factually innocent. 
  
All of the things I have mentioned so far have been a result of a combination of peoples' deep-seated drive to protect and provide for women (flying in the face of feminst claims of Patriarchy) working hand in hand with feminist ideology and activism to ""reform"" the system by stripping rights from men in addition to [fighting tooth and claw to entrench and protect these gendered disparities from actual equality](https://old.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/vvcxob/sexism_its_all_mens_fault_uk_advert/ifjppux/).",6,2025-08-12 03:14:38,False,"It often feels like the entire world is against this idea, and being a MRA is a guaranteed martyr?",85,2025-08-11 19:11:20,80,,,,,,[]

So what's the response of societies to this reality of potential violence from outside groups? How do we adapt? Just as it was the case thousands of years ago, it remains necessary to have a trained standing army to defend our groups/tribes (modern day nation states).

there are thousands of victims of DV , rape etc ebk are male who feel like and , are right to feel that way, that the help available ISNT for them. 

2. Your solution to do this is to NOT focus on helping men particularly younger men get away from violence stay in school , invest a fair amount into prostrate cancer research . Make the current shelters and help ones more gender neutral or just make male alternatives 

Instead u want to waste time trying to convince every men over the age of 30 to “change” no clue what u even on about by that

n8chdno,1mmyr2l,MensRights,LastOfSane,"I know what you mean with your question. I'm just a few steps ahead. There are essentially 2 answers to your question. The short answer is that men played a larger part in making decisions that were necessary for the survival of our species (what feminists call ""setting up the system""). The long answer is that men throughout history were basically stuck between a rock and a hard place. No matter what men did or didn't do, people starved, froze, got sick, and fought wars. Men didn't choose the conditions of our physical world, they merely reacted/adapted to the best of their abilities same as women did. The REAL system is the struggle for resources in a world of near constant scarcity and suffering.

These environmental problems have been somewhat mitigated by innovations in medicine, agriculture, technology, industrialization, etc. And it is true that changes and improvements are an ongoing process. We're all just doing the best that we can. But I refuse to stay silent when feminist debaters use ""But who set the system up?"" to avoid accountability and blame men for gender inequalities that harm men.

I will say that other signs are less noticeable within your day to day, but things like birthrate and stats on dating and marriage are symptoms showing it.

n865xez,1mmyr2l,MensRights,Winter-Marionberry91,"Yeah, they aren't thats why i said symptoms. When you have a cold, you have symptoms that identify the deeper problems. Many men and women are longer bonding and building family. This is a symptom of the constant misandry and misogynistic viewpoints.

Misandry might not get as much airtime as misogyny, but it exists in ways people often overlook:

* **Legal & courts:** Family courts tend to favor mothers in custody disputes. Men have limited recourse in cases of paternity fraud. Domestic violence resources often exclude male victims. In many countries, only men face mandatory conscription.
* **Social norms:** Men are shamed for showing emotion (“men don’t cry”), assumed to be aggressors in conflicts, and expected to take dangerous jobs or die protecting others.
* **Media tropes:** Dads are portrayed as incompetent in sitcoms, male pain is played for laughs: for example anal rape jokes about dropping the soap, and villains are disproportionately male.
* **Education & work:** Boys are disciplined more harshly in schools. Men in “female” careers like nursing face ridicule. Some scholarships/grants exclude men even in fields where they’re underrepresented.
* **Health & homelessness:** Male-specific health issues like prostate cancer get less attention/funding. Suicide rates are higher for men, yet prevention campaigns often ignore male factors. Men make up most of the homeless population but have fewer shelter options.

Honestly, though, im kinda interested in seeing this play out.

n83opye,1mmwyie,MensRights,EmirikolWoker,"> https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0032258X231159807 - study on why women retract domestic abuse allegations against male partners,

I didn't suggest you post evidence that some women retract domestic violence allegations. I suggested you share evidence of women calling for ""grace and mercy"" for male abusers, and having that be remotely respected by anyone. 
  
> It happens, it isn't a gendered thing and I'm not sure why you are arguing against me.
  
""Grace and mercy"" for domestic abusers is absolutely a gendered phenomenon. Especially considering facts such as [female criminals reported to police are less likely than male criminals to be arrested](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2004.06.006), [both men and women tend to see women as morally superior to men](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/amp0000494), and [in other forms of abuse such as sexual coercion, men are not taken as seriously as women](https://doi.org/10.1080/13552600.2016.1159343).
  
I and others argue against you when you are wrong. You have a track record of repeatedly downplaying mens' issuesas either not problems, or not mens' issues and therefore not worth talking about in mens rights advocacy spaces. For example:

This is untrue. What is true is that women will often work for less than men and take jobs that men won't. For example, I knew a manager at a restaurant called cook out. He told me that at their ""job fair"" days the majority of applicants were female, especially the ones under 18.

It's likely not. Depending on what jobs you're applying for, your race ethnicity counts more for stats about whose applying than it does for actually getting the job. A huge problem today is that most applications and resumes never see a human.

 Women are already the majority in Biomedical and Enviornmental Engineering. They also make up \~40% in Architectural, Biological and Agricutlural, Chemical, Metallurgical, and Management.

n81gfxv,1mmmqvu,MensRights,mrmensplights,"I mean, what discrimination?

Women fare better in every interaction with public institutions, and when they don’t, those institutions are often redesigned to ensure that outcome. Public schools were remade to the benefit of girls at the expense of boys, with curriculum and discipline approaches shifting toward areas where girls excel (language-heavy learning, reduced competition, group work) and away from areas where boys historically thrived (structured discipline, competitive play, hands-on technical training). Universities and colleges have more scholarships exclusively for women, eased admission requirements in certain fields to encourage female enrollment, more support programs, mentoring networks, and special career opportunities earmarked for women. Women now make up the large majority of students in higher education and thus graduate at higher rates.

Men are overwhelmingly more likely to be victims of violent crime, killed at 3–4× the rate of women, die by suicide at 3–4× the rate of women, and are given harsher sentences for the same crime compared to women with identical criminal histories. There are many more social programs for women, with social housing often earmarked for women while male homelessness - the majority of the homeless population - receives much less support and targeted intervention. Domestic violence resources are overwhelmingly female-oriented, despite a significant portion of victims being male, leaving men with few shelters or dedicated services.

In health care, women receive more preventive screening, more public health campaigns tailored to their needs, and have dedicated government offices (e.g., Offices of Women’s Health) with no equivalent for men despite worse male mortality outcomes in many categories. Public health discussions of gender gaps routinely focus on women’s disadvantages while largely ignoring male-specific health crises such as prostate cancer, workplace deaths, and suicide.

Culturally, media and entertainment frequently portray women as victims or moral guides, and men as either threats, fools, or morally defective. Advertising, public campaigns, and corporate initiatives often celebrate and promote women’s achievements explicitly, while male achievement is less highlighted unless framed as “allyship” toward women. Many corporate diversity programs have gender targets only for women, not men, even in industries where men are underrepresented (e.g., education, nursing, social work).

Legal frameworks in areas such as family court often disadvantage men, with child custody overwhelmingly awarded to mothers, and child support enforcement more aggressively applied to fathers. Sexual misconduct policies on campuses and workplaces are often written in ways that presume a male perpetrator and female victim, with procedural safeguards for the accused being weaker than in criminal courts.

Across entertainment, politics, and education, the cultural narrative positions women as needing continued institutional assistance, even in areas where they outperform men, while men’s disadvantages are often framed as personal failings rather than systemic issues.

n81b3yb,1mmmqvu,MensRights,ProfessionalDrop2949,"I believe feminism originally aimed to free both men and women from rigid gender roles. Men were expected to be breadwinners, valued only if they brought something tangible to the table. Women were pushed into passive, homemaking roles. Feminism was supposed to give everyone more freedom to choose their path. But it's lost it's way, women want equity, NOT equality. So doing less work and expecting the same results, OR being able to lie and accuse men of sexual assault without any accountability, for example.

Most of my professional experience has been in white-collar settings, where I’ve often worked with women in roles like non-technical team leads. In my experience, many have seemed unprepared or ineffective, sometimes giving vague or dismissive responses when faced with challenges. I’ve also noticed women gravitating toward office-based roles rather than physically demanding jobs like construction or fishing, which are still male-dominated. Even in these “cushier” roles, I’ve heard frequent complaints about workload or responsibilities.

I’ve also seen policies—like government grants requiring women on teams—that seem to prioritize diversity over merit. This can feel unfair, especially when I’ve found male colleagues often take more pride in their work and strive to excel. In my view, feminism sometimes pushes for equity—equal outcomes with less effort—rather than true equality of opportunity. For example, I question whether women can handle physically intense roles like firefighting due to average strength differences, and I’ve yet to work with a woman I’d call “brilliant” in a professional setting.

I think men and women are inherently different, physically and perhaps mentally, and these differences impact workplace dynamics.

> Normally I’d agree but this is a case where there is a complete and total lack of sympathy or empathy for the oppressed. In fact they are denied their reality, gaslit and the other sex will never see their perspective outside of a few outliers. The only real way to bring about any understanding that would lead to anything close to equality is by taking away the privilege of the oppressors. There’s just no way to fix things like this when half the population is dehumanized the other, yes that’s a systemic issue that’s taught in schools and also passed down generationally but there in lies the reality of what their up against  

Those who rights are being violated are always denied sympathy or empathy from rights violators and most of the population. That is how it has always worked. Do you think that when slaves and abolitionists stood up for the  rights of slaves, that they got immediate sympathy snd empathy? Hell no. The US had to fight a civil war over it. But it doesn’t help secure rights by violating rights.  

It’s not half the population dehumanized by the other. It’s most of the population doesn’t support a paper abortion. Most men don’t even support a paper abortion. The way to fix things is for men to stand up for their rights and persuade more people. That is how peaceful change to stop violating rights and secure rights occurs.  

And the anti-abortion side opposes a paper abortion more than the pro-abortion side. Giving a win to the anti-abortion side makes it harder to get a paper abortion not easier.   

And abolishing abortion is harmful for men. It violates the rights of male healthcare workers who can no longer perform abortions. It harms men who have female friends and loved ones. It makes it harder for men to have sex.   

And reasonable men and women aren’t going to support a paper abortion while women can’t abort. The whole basis for it being moral for a man to refuse to pay child support is that the woman can abort before she has the child. If a man goes into sex knowing the woman can’t abort, the woman becomes accidentally pregnant and then refuses to support the child when it’s born, then that’s immoral.

n84kzmc,1mmmqvu,MensRights,Dcave65,"Damn you’re reaching so hard, palpable desperation to be “right” and “win” the discussion. No concern for facts, truth, reality, understanding, empathy, just out here to make sure you set straight anyone who doesn’t view women as oppressed by men bc men are inherently bad and since you believe men are the only people in power the suffering of men who aren’t in power is some kind of cosmic karma or fairness. So bc men are allegedly making all the decisions the fact that 99.9% of men have no say in these matters is irrelevant, a male oligarch chooses and since he has a penis anything that happens to the men rest of the men in the world is morally their own fault and they deserve whatever they get. This is the implication your point is based off of, sounds ridiculous when you break it down past shallow surface level window dressing. 

Going for the smallest most specific points possible again it look hard to argue, can’t be easy to bypass the truth. You’re issue about rape and human trafficking isn’t a female issue btw; boys are raped and trafficked as well so as much as you want to use these things to claim your oppression and victim narrative for women it’s just another desperate reach that has no basis in reality. That is a human issue, not a woman issue, you obviously used the assumption that this doesn’t happen to boys or I suppose you just think they deserve it or perhaps you just don’t see anyone with a penis as a person who is capable of living a life that’s unfair and horrific.  I dont blame you, you’re just following the programming, and the programming says that any point that challenges your world view must be terminated. It’s a threat to your world view which internally feels like a real threat that could harm you, it’s this automatic response that manifests itself from years of propaganda that started at a young age and was shown in ways to really create an emotional response in children. It’s the same thing we do when we teach history, anything religious or racial is taught in school with max emotional impact, they want the children to essentially be traumatized by it to the point that they will carry a strong feeling through their lives regarding who are victims and who are oppressors. The fact that the pendulum has swung so far the other direction, and those things that happened occurred before any of the kids were born doesn’t factor in. That part is ignored, no, these things were an issue 40 years ago and we must pretend there’s still an inherent bias that’s never been fixed.

n85zqwi,1mmmqvu,MensRights,highspeedsteely,"""Men can't be the victim. They were victimized by other men!"" So if a woman is raped by other women, these women aren't victims? If a large group of exclusively women were raped by other women, it's not women being victimized? This question also has to do with men being raped by other men, especially in prisons, btw.

""There are practical reasons outside of discrimination for men being studied on more.""
""Women are biased against in medicine and therefore victims."" How do you disprove your own argument like this?

Not even mentioning the fact that you aren't anywhere close to a doctor, so you have no clue as to what kind of studies are being done or what conditions need to be met to diagnose endometriosis, but 14 years is just not a believable number, are you in the Canadian Healthcare system? There are several different diagnostic tests doctors can do if they suspect it, and none of them take 14 years. Not only that, but it's progressive disease with observable symptoms like pain and excess bleeding. There are also different treatments such as hormone therapy and surgery. The more likely reality is that you're listing misdiagnosed cases, cases in which the disease was passive enough to be unnoticed for a time, and/or general outliers.

Also, since you didnt bother telling us what endometriosis is, it's a genetic condition(genetic as in correlating with family history, I don't think the disease has a defined cause), where the woman's own uterus tissue grows outside of it, breaking apart surrounding tissue. This is hard to cure or study for the same reason all genetic conditions are hard to cure or study. It's harder to study and cure, in fact. It has nothing to do with women being less studied on.",3,2025-08-11 12:48:04,False,"I am tired of hearing how women are allegedly discriminated against, when in real life I can see lots of blatant discrimination agaisnt men instead",564,2025-08-10 09:19:56,92,,,,,,[]

Women take better care of themselves, so for every little ailment they seek a doctor, and demand a thorough investigation. This leads to much wasted time for doctors, which causes them to be more dismissive.

Meanwhile men wait longer to see the doctor, and only go when something obviously bad is going on. This causes doctors to take mens ailments more seriously. 

However, the result is that doctors more often see the women, and in most cases can treat them earlier and thus better. Leading to a longer lifespan for women.

Women are programmed to look for men who they think is capable of providing plentiful resources for them and their future potential children down the line. The ones whom they think are unable to are generally the ones who are deemed undesirable by women and society as a whole. 

Women do not have to put in effort to reproduce. They are the ones who choose who is worthy and who is not worthy, so to speak. Men, on the other hand, only a fraction of us used to reproduce back in prehistoric times. We're programmed to be extremely competitive and we will literally end each other for a chance at reproduction. It is one of our greatest goals in life to prove that our DNA is worth keeping in the world.

Now, obviously, we do not live in caves anymore, but our lizard brains think we still do. Women are attracted to men with options, because the men who are at the top are desired by a lot of other women. It is that way because they convey that they're able to provide. Something in women's brains tell them that this man is able to survive for a very long time and thus is capable of providing her with a lot of resources for a long time. That's what subconsciously makes a man desirable to women. Good or nice men do not appeal to this instinct like the men at the top of the attractiveness scale do, because being nice tells her nothing about your ability to hunt and survive.

n82slda,1mmwq3h,MensRights,Ace2Face,"It's your responsibility in most countries to do a paternity test. In many countries it's not legal to do so without the permission of the mother (in the U.S it's alright, but you should double check). This probably doesn't stop you from gathering a sample and sending it overseas, or just doing it illegally. You could also just be up front to your GF or wife about it, frame it as a ""peace of mind"" or as a ""formality"". Not to mention sometimes babies get swapped out, so you could phrase it like that. You could also try discussing this matter to see what is her position on paternity testing to begin with, beat around the bush.

Once sufficient time passes, you become the de-facto father and courts view biological parenthood as symbolic at best. You can't just abandon the kid financially because he didn't do anything wrong.

It should be mandated in my opinion, if a woman knows for sure who the mother is, the father should know as well. But for men who are aware of the problem, it's a solvable problem. The problem are the masses of naive men who think society has their back and they have rights. It's only by coming here that the things that I took for granted were actively denied to me in the first place.

If you tested every child when they are still a baby (which I do support - not just as a men's rights issue - there are instances of maternity wards accidentally swapping newborns) then you'd find way less than 30% negative - today, people only get paternity tests for one of 3 reasons. Either she's been sleeping around and doesn't know who the father it, or he suspects she's been sleeping around and doesn't trust that he's the father, or he's clinging to a hope that he isn't the father and trying to get out of maintenance. Either way, people get paternity tests for a reason and the negative results would be much lower if all were tested.

The rate found when paternity isn't a concern is more like 1-2% - and that's still too high. 1 in 50-100 men having the course of the rest of their life changed entirely based on one core monumental lie is totally unacceptable.

Its necessary to learn and adapt, to this you're absolutely right, but the goal is to be able to escape and to not end up in another relationship of the same kind. 

>He’s likely with her for lots of good reasons but this particular dynamic is causing him harm.

Or maybe he is married and/or has a child with her and she's using that as blackmail (I stayed in a relationship 6 years because of that) until she cheated on me and made false accusations against me. Have not seen my child in 2 years. 

>By getting a better understanding of his own triggers he can effectively prepare for future instances without becoming defense.

Why should he have to live like this tho? You're basicaly telling him to be responsible for her toxic behaviour and to keep living in emotional unstability. 

>Just staying calm will help her relax away from whatever defense structure she’s activated at the moment.

This is paid labor, its called being a therapist and a partner shouldn't be treated as one. 

>OP needs to learn how to process his own emotional material, as does his partner.

Yes he does, and the best way to do that, the first step is by getting away from the abuser.... 

>If they cannot do that without causing harm, then indeed they should consider separating. 

Are you silly? The minute one become abusive the relationship should be over, this idea take even more credit when you see the current societal climat we live in and how unbalanced the law is when it come to this particular issue. 

Again, I was in an abusive relationship for 6 years, gathered proofs of all my claims, all she had to do was to say that I was the author of all the abuse she did to me and our son and it was all that was heard by court, they did not even want to check my material. 

This is why men should end such relationships as soon as they spot a spark of abuse. 

> “She has to go” is just kind of an unhealthy way to frame it. She’s not an old carton of yogurt, she’s an human being the OP possibly loves.

There is a massive correlation between girls without dads at home and all manner of negative outcomes. Why? 

Among the many reasons is because daughters learn emotional regulation from well regulated fathers seek out well regulated men for partners, and it’s true the other way; women w dysregulated or absent father figures seek unstable men far more often.

That film was government-funded and intended quite clearly to push a ""white males are the problem"" narrative... yet it was based on a crime committed by a black guy, and released at the height of concern about violent acts that were committed by African and Pakistani perpetrators. 

I mean if Andrew Tate (whom I hold in absolute contempt) and dangerous misogyny are *so dangerous* why isn't the UK full of rampant sexist hate crimes against women being committed by ethnically British (or ethnically European) males? 

>this policy specifically targeting dangerous misogyny has been going on for 10 years

And I'm sure its never been falsely applied *even once* to tame MRA views... note the sarcasm.

>Because as of yet it's just you fantasizing about something that isn't reflected in the actual policy

You seem to lack understanding of just how much discretion the civil service has over how a policy is enforced. Yes, on paper, Parliament is sovereign. In reality, it is very easy for Whitehall to subvert/undermine or just ""massage"" a policy to operate in a particular manner. This is so well-known that the BBC had a very famous, long-running comedy about it called *Yes, Prime Minister.*

And again, Whitehall is basically an ideological monoculture with distinctly feminist views. In an environment like that, non-controversial MRA viewpoints like ""the pay gap doesn't exist - it has been illegal to pay people different amounts for the same work for decades, and economist after economist including Nobel Laureates have never found significant evidence of discrimination on the basis of sex"" (a completely true statement, by the way) **absolutely will be treated as impermissible hate speech**.",3,2025-08-10 15:53:41,False,"Parents refer more teen boys to Government's deradicalisation scheme ""Prevent"" after hit Netflix drama Adolescence OP: More male hate",466,2025-08-10 02:48:34,82,,,,,,[]

n83w955,1mmvlfj,MensRights,MaleEducation1,"Fun fact: [Women earned \~20% of the Bachelor's degree in 1920 and\~40% in 1930](https://www.reddit.com/user/MaleEducation1/comments/1lr3sc7/us_percentage_of_bachelors_degrees_earned_by/). It was similar for Master's degrees.

Most people would think there were no women at all in college in the 1950's.....

If it wasn't for the G.I. Bill passed in 1944 leading to more male veterans join in college and more males enrolling in college to dodge the vietnam draft, **women would have surpassed men in college in earning Bachelor's in 1940's itself** rather than early 1980's.

Obviously people will say ""Title IX"" helped achieve this parity, when it was already bound to happen.

Not to mention, [girls have outnumbered boys amongst high school graduates (except for a couple of years) since records were first kept in 1870](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d09/tables/dt09_103.asp). It was bad as 60-40 in the 1800's. Boys have also always made the majority of drop outs.

[Girls have also gotten better grades than boys in almost all subjects ever since records were kept (110+ years)](http://time.com/81355/girls-beat-boys-in-every-subject-and-they-have-for-a-century/). [Same for college since at least 1970's](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED423210.pdf).

Despite the so-called ""STEM gap"", [girls have gotten much better grades and taken more advanced coursework in Matha and Science for the last 40+ years](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaleEducation/comments/1lqzp0l/the_myth_of_the_math_gender_gap_at_least_in_the/).

Boys did well on standardized testing which might have made this not go to notice. Obviously, no one ever cared about schools being unfriendly to or not well suited for boys, this has been talked about since 1909. Boys were drugged and now there are talks about holding them back a year.

**Females have never fallen behind Males in education in the United States since records were kept. Despite this we had bills passed to bridge this ""imaginary gap"" and so much money wasted on other initiatives.**

Most of it is soft locked. Most people make a wage. A wage requires you to work a set amount of time for a set amount of money that every employer wants you to over perform on. Your over-performance is typically how much of your effort evaporates without compensation that you KNOW about.


If that doesn't work, we've got inflation, taking everyone's money and making copies of it to sell at the previous money's value until people catch on that the sauce was diluted. Now everyone needs more of the money to do the same thing. But the higher class of people don't have their money capped off by time or wage, those people's efforts are easier to scale to the nonsense. 


Women can play a role but it's also social. If all the consumption we do isn't backed by social value by peers locally, we shove ourselves online to get the reinforcement to do what we want with people we want. From family values to gaming, political and media preferences, the people we came to find can now control us and each other by forming a larger group and controlling the narrative. You might like the best games, but I checked your posts and you are whatever political party, or you live at home still, you're too thirsty for a relationship, or you practice men's rights... No friendship for you. Get ostracized. 


Manipulation is everywhere... But financially it's come to a point where buying a technological trinket costs less than eating a proper meal. Basically, needs and social satisfaction being monetized heavily and commercialized regardless if you pay or not is the current issue. If you want things to talk about with people you're either going to have to live off the news like your pappy or pay money to keep up with the Kardashians... And most of the time what you are rewarded with is some foil hat equivalent of people who live and breathe by the content you consumed to relate to them.


It just feels like everything got paywalled. Friendships, relationships, conversations, hangouts, groups, health, education, etc...

So first of all, I dunno if you're a native English speaker or not, but that's not how this sentence is supposed to be structured. You're about 3 steps off from literal gibberish. What I think you *meant* to say is that:

""So instead of actually answering the issue I'm raising, you go on to take personal offence.""

n7rrmlx,1mli8bf,MensRights,xxTheMagicBulleT,"I don't care. If women wanna play games and play lose. They beter not complain when the same shit happens to them.

Cause anything they do to others they have no right to complain about when others do it to them. If you can't have high standards for your self then no one has to live up to the standard you demand of others.

Why Im a librarian. I belief in be for others that others are for you. And if others treat you poorly I treat them just as poorly.

I live by the standards I demand of others. And of others play games I join in and play the game in kind. 

So if women wanna be lose with sex thats fine. Im fine with a good time not a long time women.

I just don't worry all that much about women acting out. I just invest based on how women invest. If they selfish I invest a little and be at a level I get what I want out off it. And then stop investing. Or even pull back when they do things I dislike.

I don't really take the effort to whine and fight with women. I just step back or walk away.

I always go out to go for a serious relationship in mind but I have no problems playing the dumb games women like playing. 

Especially when women have like big egos and a lot of wild demands I just laugh about it and say good luck with that.

People that don't hold the same standards for there self as they demand of others. No one should take those people seriously. 

But I find that at both extreme sides. People that want people to force the other side to jump true hoops they them self would never do for there partner are unworthy of love. Unworthy of respect or consideration. So people that deserve to be alone.

So matter what side or who we talking about. Its just women get seen at the same level as children so they get away with much more bullshit. But I don't care and I refuse to play that game. 

Or even give any head space room too those selfish people.

But with that law change. I would definitely not have any part in relationships full stop. Or have children thats wild. So many places has insane laws now.

n7rerxg,1mli8bf,MensRights,jack_avram,"The UN Human Rights Committee monitors compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which India has ratified, and could view India’s paternity law requiring maternal consent or proof of nonaccess before allowing a DNA test as violating international human rights standards. The law may infringe on the father’s rights to privacy, family life, and equality before the law under ICCPR Articles 17 and 26, and the child’s right to identity under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Because India has not signed the First Optional Protocol, individuals cannot submit complaints directly, but concerns can be raised through NGO shadow reports, state-to-state complaints, or by engaging UN Special Rapporteurs who may question the government. This process can highlight violations, draw international attention, and create diplomatic pressure, though it does not produce binding legal orders and functions mainly as an advocacy mechanism.

ICCPR Articles:

Article 17 of the ICCPR protects individuals from arbitrary or unlawful interference with their privacy and family life, which can include the right to establish biological parentage.

Article 26 guarantees equality before the law and prohibits discrimination, requiring that men and women have equal legal opportunities in matters such as paternity.



The most likely way to change India’s paternity law is through a constitutional challenge in its Supreme Court or High Courts using equality and privacy rights under the Constitution, supported by India’s international treaty obligations.",9,2025-08-09 04:34:11,False,Cheating by women is ok now.

n7tfnur,1mli8bf,MensRights,Dcave65,"The states themselves are highly incentivized by the federal govt to collect as much child support as possible. The amount of men who can’t afford to live, lost their jobs and have no way of paying, fall behind and owe tends of thousands of dollars are all staggering statically. It’s a huge reason for the massive amount of male suicide which is one of the leading causes of death for men. You couldn’t find any other cause of death that our society cares less about than male suicide, it’s seriously an absolute joke. There is no support for men in these circumstances, there is no way out beyond death.  The only time it gets any attention is when one of these men decide to kill their ex wife, and all the coverage of that is just demonizing the man and completely leaves out the system that pushed him past his limits. The part that’s so hard for these men is how massively unfair and tilted the game is, they never stood a chance and if they try to fight back they are often hit with false accusations that ruin their careers and any future they could have had. Lastly, it makes it impossible for them to find a new partner in life as no matter how much they make the child support goes up and wipes out nearly all of the additional earnings, remember child support is taxed for the father and tax free for the mother, essentially any amount payed is actually costing the father 30-40% more than what is received by the mother. Now the father cannot qualify for any govt or state help bc his earnings appear to be enough to survive on and none of these programs account for child support. So even though the amount he is forced to live on normally would qualify for food stamps, public housing, state medical coverage, etc, he cannot receive any of these things no matter how destitute he becomes as they look at his earnings and write him off. If a man is fired from his job and cannot find employment he still incurs the same child support amount, during Covid this racked up billions of debt for men in America, the state doesn’t care, they expect you to pull the money out of thin air and if you can’t find a job that pays what you made before you are generally screwed and will end up going to jail for contempt.",2,2025-08-09 11:41:07,False,Cheating by women is ok now.

n7q2nrq,1mleqn7,MensRights,NAWALT_VADER,"Another way to look at it:

Based on an analysis of NIH research funding for major gender-specific cancers, there is a significant disparity in investment that favors conditions affecting women. For fiscal year 2024, the combined research funding for breast and ovarian cancer totals approximately **$1.04 billion**, while funding for prostate and testicular cancer is about **$382 million**. This gap becomes even more pronounced when measured against mortality rates. The average research investment per death for these women's cancers is nearly **$19,000**. In stark contrast, the investment per death for the men's cancers is about **$10,500**. This means that, within the scope of these diseases, the research investment per life is nearly twice that for women's conditions than for men's.

This data reframes the common narrative about healthcare priorities. While women were historically underrepresented in medical research, decades of advocacy and policy changes have resulted in robust, well-funded research programs for key women's diseases. The notion that men are broadly favored in healthcare outcomes is challenged by their shorter average lifespans and, as this analysis shows, lower relative research funding for their primary gender-specific cancers. Ultimately, the numbers indicate that when it comes to the major cancers that exclusively affect one gender, the focus of federal research investment is more heavily weighted toward women's health.

Because the vast majority of these diseases are affecting people in their 50s and up.  If there was the kind of age disparity you're talking (10 vs. 70) about I'd be inclined to agree, but there isn't.

Because the dollars spent per person with a disease is a very important factor to consider when comparing how much is spent per person with a disease.

> I don't understand what exactly is being debunked here? Are you trying to say that the measure is unreasonable, or are you trying to say that the funding isn't disproportionate compared to the benefit gained.

Both.  They used the measurement that would allow them to twist the data to favour the conclusion they aimed to find.  Further evidence of this can be seen in the list of ""gender neutral"" diseases; suicide, meth, violence, and injury all affect men more than women, even by their own selection process.  I'd wager hypertension and a few others also should be moved.  Their math also doesn't add up.  They conclude that, by their numbers, men are favoured on 25 diseases, yet when you simply count the number of male dominated and male semi dominated diseases there are only 16 diseases.

n7qdenx,1mleqn7,MensRights,NAWALT_VADER,"I like data. Here is more info, for those who don't want to dive into the links above:

Based on estimated figures for Fiscal Year 2024, an analysis of NIH research funding reveals a significant disparity in investment for certain gender-specific cancers. By dividing the research funding by the estimated annual deaths for each condition, we can calculate a ""funding per death"" figure that offers a clear comparison. For women, breast cancer received approximately $779 million in funding, with an estimated 42,170 deaths, resulting in a funding per death of $18,472.85. Similarly, ovarian cancer, with $264 million in funding and 12,730 deaths, saw a per-death investment of $20,738.41. For men, the numbers are notably different. Prostate cancer, with $373 million in funding and 35,770 deaths, had a funding per death of $10,427.73. Testicular cancer, with $9 million in funding and 600 deaths, received $15,000 per death. 

In summary again, the total federal research funding for women's conditions, specifically breast and ovarian cancer, amounts to approximately $1.04 billion, allocated to a combined total of 54,900 estimated annual deaths. This translates to an average investment of roughly $18,998 for every woman who dies from one of these diseases. In contrast, the total funding for men's conditions, prostate and testicular cancer, is around $382 million, for a total of 36,370 deaths. This results in a significantly lower average funding per death of about $10,503. This analysis shows that, within the scope of these four cancers, the research investment per death for women's conditions is approximately 81% higher than for men's.",5,2025-08-08 22:32:17,False,"""men get more healthcare funding"" and why that's a lie",181,2025-08-08 19:55:05,23,,,,,,[]

That's what the person was trying to say.

In the context of gender-specific cancer research, the available government data shows that funding for research benefiting women is almost twice as high as funding for research benefiting men. This is only counting cancers unique to each sex, not cancers like lung cancer, which historically affected men more but has gained more funding as women’s rates increased.

Men and women make up roughly equal portions of the population globally, so population size isn’t really a deciding factor here. What does differ significantly is mortality: men generally have higher death rates across most major health categories.

Given that, it’s worth asking whether the funding balance should shift somewhat toward men’s physical and mental health. If the goal is to reduce overall mortality and improve quality of life, then men’s health might deserve a larger share of the research focus than it’s currently getting.",12,2025-08-09 00:39:00,False,"""men get more healthcare funding"" and why that's a lie",181,2025-08-08 19:55:05,23,,,,,,[]

n7o4zxj,1ml4fcd,MensRights,Winter-Marionberry91,"Yep, I have noticed it too.

It is calculated control. Over time, families stop trusting a father’s ability to lead, which opens the door for outside influences to take over. This applies to both his wife and his kids. The family is being quietly disarmed, and most people do not even realize it.

The poison is subtle, but it is destroying families, and many will be lost in this battle. I am not here to take away anyone’s love, but in today’s society, if you are single, the safest choice is to stay that way. If that is not possible, look for someone deeply traditional who avoids gossip circles like the news, social media, and even modern movies. These women are often labeled “oppressed” by feminists, so you will both be called names anyway.

Everyone, in some sense, serves a master. Some people understand this and choose wisely. Others think they are free, only to end up serving someone who does not care about them. That is most of society today, listening to a boss for a paycheck instead of to their father, who only wanted them to succeed in life without cost and maybe even with great gain. 🤷‍♂️

It's not for nothing, that the father is painted as incapable, it's all apart of the strategy. They are over all after the kids themselves though, but you have to disarm the father and cuddle the wife to get to them.

Go look at #metoo and how men were told to fuck off. Feminism absolutely treats rape like a gendered issue and constantly and routinely erases male rape vicrims. 


A tiny minority of feminists might actually care about male vicrims, but the vast majority of feminists treat equality like a one way street exclusively to the benefit of men.

2. Reasons stated might be not actual reasons, but merely rationalisations. A person might rationalise a reason, for actions that were not reasonable to begin with.
3. I remember seeing some meta-analysis of birthrate breakdowns within populations, mostly in Japan, that shown basically that the younger woman gives births, the more likely she is to have more than one child. Meanwhile women who postpone children to later years, tend to have either one or no children. Basically meaning that women who go for education or career are highly unlikely to have 2 or more children or any at all.
4. 4B movement or feminism are highly unlikely to be the reasons for low birthrates. Both feminism and 4B movement are miniscule in comparison to Anglosphere nations, while birthrates are far lower in South Korea and other Asian countries. So in fact you could actually draw the opposite conclusion that higher feminism = higher birthrate, but that would be a false equivalence argument.

“When it comes to male suicide, we have solid data showing relationship breakdown is critical - coroner’s report data published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that among men 25-44, the biggest cause of suicide is now “problems in spousal relationship circumstances”.”

That term is part of the problem 

>men just need to learn to cry.....

That is not the best way to phrase it. A better way would be 'to release emotions in a cathartic manner'. You don't have to cry, to do that. There are many ways to do that, and that is down to the individual.

Men need to be let free of this 'provider' mentality. 

For better or worse we are in a post feminist world. Only many men are stuck in a pre feminist mindset (family, protector) mindset.

You have to let go of your shackles and live your life for you on your own terms for yourself.

Better question u/Sad_Funny_7027 why are you supporting inflicting physical and psychological trauma on infants / young boys?  
My suspicion is you actually have a large amount of resentment for what happened to you and the fact that you were mutilated and so the only way you can find any sort of closure to your suffering is to push for others to be mutilated as you were.

At least, that's my working theory right now..",17,2025-08-09 22:15:47,False,Whats wrong with circumcision?,0,2025-08-09 19:15:52,18,,,,,,[]

n7w3t2f,1mm6tzx,MensRights,peasey360,Ask yourself why female circumcision is outlawed in the west and you’ll have your answer.  All circumcision was not started because of wonderful health benifits or because adults got to choose it for themselves.  It was started by sick men as a means of reducing sensitivity to cure “evil masturbation” thus reducing quality of life for anyone circumcised.  The difference between uncut and cut is like the difference between normal vision and being colorblind.  The styles today remove so much skin the frenelum is almost completely removed and a ton of men have trouble reaching orgasm or staying hard during intercourse because there’s incentive to harvest stem cells from infant foreskins to be sold for a hefty profit thus motivating doctors to take the maximum amount of skin possible producing tight erections which come with hefty issues.  Any so called “benifits” are overshadowed by the evil original intent and the horrors beyond our imagination that is tissue harvesting.  Don’t even get me started on how cats get better painkiller for a tooth cleaning than infants get for genital mutilation.,19,2025-08-09 21:43:50,False,Whats wrong with circumcision?,0,2025-08-09 19:15:52,18,,,,,,[]

I'm also not saying that speaking up against unfairness is hate, once again you are arguing against something I didn't say. 

""No one is saying ALL women are awful""?

Here is an exact quote of a comment from the last thing I engaged with on this sub:

""I hope there is a special place for apologists like you. It's literal crime done with the sole reason he was a man and nothing else. This is typical woman behavior. She even shot at a day care above all. That's all they are capable of, and will ever be capable of.""

The context is a man being murdered by a woman. So murder is typical women's behaviour? Women are only capable of murder, nothing else? Seems like women hating to me.

In this instance the only hint we had at a motivation for the murder was the women telling police not to save his life, and that he was a monster. She was arrested on site. No preferential treatment for being a woman. No indication that the reason she murdered him had anything to do with him being a man. Her words suggest she believed he did something awful and deserved to die, but maybe she was just deranged, who knows.

The comment I made was pointing out that this wasn't a men's rights issue, owing to the lack of preferential treatment or misandrist motive, but the person replying to me was so blinded by his hate and rage for women he couldn't see that simple logic. He was just looking for any excuse to express his hate for women.

Comments like this happen far too frequently, though most are less obvious, and it makes all the reasonable people look bad by association.

Yes, reinforcing what I said before because those are the people I am criticising. I'm not criticising people who have reasonable concerns about  the various ways men are treated unfairly legally or socially. I'm one of those people, that's why I'm in this sub!

>You repeatedly take umbrage with simple disagreements and conflate them with men thinking the worst about women.

**When? What simple disagreement have I taken and conflated with men thinking the worst about women?** The only example I've given - saying murder is typical woman behaviour - is an extremely hateful thing to say. Again, you are making things up.

>You exactly are taking issue with men speaking up against double standards, otherwise you wouldn't make accusations of hate every time it happens.

No I'm not, I hate those double standards myself. **If you genuinely believe this show me a quote where I said that people complaining of double standards are woman haters.**

I gave you a specific example, which you have conveniently ignored. Here are a few specific examples from comments on only this thread, thankfully not as harsh as the ""all women are murderers"" example:

* I always give women the benefit of the doubt and then shit like this happens. I hate women.
* It’s a mad world. Nuff said. They want equality when it suits them. Essentially masterful manipulators who are self centered and self serving.
* ""women aren’t the problem"" Funny

And for balance, here are examples of more reasonable people, examples that thankfully are in the majority, these are the the kind of people/comments/attitudes I support and am explicitly not criticising:

* Ofcourse even with all this, I dont hate women because then I'd be just as much of a hypocrite. I think women in general are just normal people, some good some bad, and thats the mindset we should be encouraging, not supporting blatant prejudice
* God I wish there are alot more women like the women in the metro letting op sit next to her 5 year old daughter because some other woman was clearly harassing op
* What about the lady at the end bro. We can't leave her hanging for those other parasite women. Try to maintain your love for that woman. The rest forget em, but dont make her pay for it. All that will do is scare her to their hateful side. But I understand your anger bro, I feel it too 😔
* Much love to the kind woman in your experience. She is literally more valuable than gold and silver, and i hope she knows. As for the other creatures hidden in a female body. 🤢🤢🤢 BE GONE DARK SPIRIT. Thanks for sharing this experience and including the positive one. Made my day, brother. 💙

Women are oppressed by not being forced into the meat-grinder and being forced to have others be obligated to their wellbeing. Being forced into the meat-grinder and obligated to support your moral betters is in mens interests and a reward for men for being men. If this situation was inverted, give your previous comments, I suspect you would have no trouble framing it as oppression and marginalisation of women because of their gender.
  
>  preventing them from having a bank account
  
Most people didn't have bank accounts until relatively recently, because of class rather than gender. Mens' obligation for the wellbeing of women came with the rights to determine how assets were used up until the Married Womens Property Act of 1882. This allowed women the ""feme sole"" rights of single women (who *were* allowed to have bank accounts, among other things), while retaining the obligations of the men in their life for their upkeep, including payment of taxes on that property. This was used to great effect by Suffragette and medical doctor Dr. Elizabeth Wilkes, who had her husband incarcerated for tax evasion by refusing to disclose her earnings to him, making it impossible for him to pay taxes. 
  
> freedom outside the home
  
What does that even mean? Women have always worked (rather than ""not being allowed to work"" as feminists like to claim), and oftentimes that includes travelling to your place of work (especially during and after the Industrial Revolution, when ones workplace tended not to also be ones home). 
  
> not being able to vote
  
Voting rights have always been connected to obligations of civil and military conscription. In gaining women the vote, first wave feminists created a two-tier society, one where men paid for their citizenship rights with citizenship obligations to civil and military conscription, and where women got citizenship rights (the vote) gratis. In the UK, men and women gained equal voting rights in 1968, when the draft was abolished. In the US, they still don't have equal rights. 
  
> I agree that these gender norms have placed unfair burdens on men and said gender norms should be dismantled to benefit everyone

Class definitely did play a role when it came to finance in the UK but it would be intellectually dishonest of you to state that class was the only reason women had difficulty accessing/ opening bank accounts. Many banks required a signature from the woman's husband for approval and would routinely deny unmarried women loans or mortgages, this is why the  Sex Discrimination Act 1975 was put in place. 

Women have always worked and I'm not claiming that they haven't, what I'm saying is that society was not built for women to be independent i.e. until the late 19th century, women did not have a separate legal identity from their husband, couldn't own property/ sign contracts, needed husband/ father permission to make decisions etc. As well as the social expectation that women who didn't follow gender norms were 'unfeminine' and 'morally suspect', this encouraged women to stay in the home.

You're completely incorrect about voting in the UK, men who were 21+ gained the right to vote in 1918 and some women over 30 gained the right to vote. Only men 18-41 were conscripted, if a 'two tier society' existed then ONLY men who served in the military would be allowed to vote, the vote was influenced by wanting to encourage unity after WW1. Women fought for decades for the right to vote and achieved this in 1928, they were also conscripted in 1941 where it was compulsory for women to sign up for war work.

n7limzu,1mka7vn,MensRights,EmirikolWoker,"> I'm not sure what you mean by 'forced into the meat grinder'

Military conscription. It's fairly common slang, I'm surprised you haven't come across it before. It would also apply to particularly strenuous and dangerous occupations. It could arguably apply to civil conscription too, such as Hue and Cry laws. 
  
> If you're referring to having to work historically, yes, women were oppressed for being largely excluded from the workforce 
  
No women ever worked on the farm? No female brewers or weavers (from which the surnames Brewster and Webster arise respectively)? Dr. Elizabeth Wilkes didn't exist? The women on the Masters Roll of the Most Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths from the 1600s simply didn't exist? 
  
> Women have always worked and I'm not claiming that they haven't
  
Except where they were ""were oppressed for being largely excluded from the workforce"". So were you lying then, or are you lying now? 
  
> it would be intellectually dishonest of you to state that class was the only reason women had difficulty accessing/ opening bank accounts
  
Did I state that? I did state that class was a key barrier in *anyone* accessing a bank account. It would be intellectually dishonest, not to mention misrepresenting a position, to claim otherwise. You should know all about that, you keep moaning about it when I've accurately quoted you. 
  
> Many banks required a signature from the woman's husband for approval
  
Yes. Because he was liable for any charges and fees for his wife's decisions. If women had obligations to men without rights required to back that up, you'd be happy to say that was oppression. 
  
> what I'm saying is that society was not built for women to be independent
  
Yes. Women had and have the right to the labour and wealth of men. In days gone by, men were allowed rights to go along with their obligations, but as soon as we (as a culture) were able to do so, we removed the restrictions on women first, or only. If it were reversed, you would have no trouble recognising that as marginalising based on gender.
  
> Only men 18-41 were conscripted,
  
[And there was no pressure on men to enter the meat-grinder otherwise](https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/White-Feather-Movement/). You're also forgetting about the levy system. Men have been conscripted into war for most if not all of human history. 
  
> they were also conscripted in 1941 where it was compulsory for women to sign up for war work. 
  
Working in a factory is in no way comparable to being shot at, gassed, or being captured and tortured by Nazis. It's intellectually dishonest to claim that womens civil conscription is in any way equivalent to men's military conscription. 
  
> I have a question though, why do you continuously challenge me? We seem to have the same conversations quite regularly

n7lmj1g,1mka7vn,MensRights,Upstairs_Ear4172,"Thanks for clarifying what you meant by meat grinder.

I said 'largely excluded', not that they were completely excluded. I provided links that demonstrate how they ere excluded in some ways, I never implied that women never worked, I actually said the opposite. Reading comprehension is key.

You said, 'Most people didn't have bank accounts until relatively recently, because of class rather than gender', you didn't say that class was a key barrier for anyone.

The existence of some responsibilities (like husbands being liable for debts) doesn’t negate structural advantages. Women didn’t have the choice to be the debtor, the signer, the landowner. You're framing male burden as oppression, while ignoring male privilege. That’s not intellectually honest.

On conscription, yes, military service has disproportionately impacted men, and that’s a serious issue. But you're using it to imply that any progress for women has been at men's expense. That's not how equality works. Female factory workers in WWII weren’t in combat but their labor wasn't easy or safe either. If you genuinely care about burdens, you should advocate for abolishing unfair roles for everyone, not just protect the status quo for men.

I don't believe I should be exempt from criticism at all, I welcome criticism which is why I said I'm open to it, I was simply asking what you get out of continuously replying to me.

n7lqe9s,1mka7vn,MensRights,EmirikolWoker,"> I said 'largely excluded', not that they were completely excluded.
  
""largely excluded"" can be read to mean""more often than not"". And one of the examples you gave was working in mines - women are legally barred from working where they'll get black lung, likely while having a child with them due to breastfeeding concerns (who would also get black lung), and that oppresses women rather than benefits them. 
  
>You said, 'Most people didn't have bank accounts until relatively recently, because of class rather than gender', you didn't say that class was a key barrier for anyone.
  
Yes. Because for most of history, poor people didn't get bank accounts. Reading comprehension is key. 
  
>  You're framing male burden as oppression, while ignoring male privilege. That’s not intellectually honest.

And you're not framing female burden as oppression while ignoring female privileges? Like the example above?
  
If I'm being intellectually dishonest, so are you. Hell, so is the whole of feminist ideology.
  
>  But you're using it to imply that any progress for women has been at men's expense.
  
If you're reading this into what I said, that's on you. I pointed out that feminism's first big success was the establishment of a society where one class got the right to vote, and the other class had the right to vote that was conditional of their submission to civil and military conscription. If you're taking that to mean that I oppose any progress for women on the basis of it being at mens expense, that's coming from your brain, not my words. You keep strawmanning arguments you don't like. That's lying, again.

I think women who parrot that shit don't realize that a lot of people fester on negativity... When insecure men, not just the ones called that, have to live in their own mind, their own character comes into question... And you can't really tell people who you are, you have to let other people tell you, and a lot of these types of women have nothing nice to say about men.


Suicide rates cannot be from nothing... They're from expectations and duties to perform. They're from the looks they get, and the disappointment they hear and feel from their partners, parents and children, maybe even peers, from being inadequate. A requirement women don't experience as often because all the modern woman is expected to be is pretty, and that's something you can see, so you don't get with a woman thinking, ""she'll be prettier in a few years."" 


If I knew I could effectively kill people by making them feel like crap... It would be the last thing I want to do.

Your hypocrisy is textbook
Take a small minority of bad actors in a group e.g., violent men.
Apply their crimes to the entire group.
Justify it under “precaution” while pretending it’s not prejudice.
Cry foul when anyone applies the same reasoning back at you.

 if i applied your logic to infanticide, we’d have to say “All mothers are a threat to their children” because statistically, more infants are killed by women than men. you’d call that sexist, bigoted, and “harmful rhetoric.” But when it’s aimed at men? Oh, suddenly it’s “just reality.”

The “difference in strength” line is also hilarious in how selectively it’s used. When it benefits the argument, biology matters. But the second you point out.

men dominate dangerous labor jobs because of strength

men make better candidates in certain physically demanding fields
…suddenly it’s “gender roles are outdated, strength doesn’t matter!”


And the fear argument? That’s self confirming bias. If you spend your life convinced men are out to get you, you’ll interpret every neutral interaction as “proof"". You're not basing your worldview on lived danger, you're basing it on manufactured paranoia pumped into you by media, activist rhetoric, and an echo chamber that rewards victimhood.

Bottom line you're not talking about safety, you're talking about maintaining a gynocentric victim narrative where women must always be seen as the more endangered sex so they can keep justifying biased laws and social double standards.

That’s not how accountability or change works. You should call it out sharply when it’s asymmetric hate masked as virtue. The polite softening of language is a weapon used to diffuse moral outrage, which is necessary for social correction.


>All humans deserve dignity.

That’s not the problem here. The problem is who society chooses to protect and who it chooses to throw under the bus. When men get told to kill themselves online and it's brushed off as ""banter"" or ""deserved because patriarchy,"" that isn't universal hate, that's targeted misandry being normalized.

It’s not ""sports."" It’s identity based double standards weaponized by ideologues who want power, not fairness. These people will milk their victimhood to gain social capital, and then when men speak up, it’s suddenly “stop dividing people, we’re all human.”

You don’t solve problems by making them invisible under a moral fog of “everyone hurts.” That’s erasure, not empathy.

Campaigns like 'teach men not to rape' or 'stop domestic abuse against women' not only go out of their way to neglect male victims, these make it harder to garner support for male victims.

n7gp9tb,1mjz859,MensRights,MindoverMuddle,"Exactly 

Femicide laws, make the killing of women a “special” crime while male homicides get no equivalent category its a masterclass

There’s no record of misandrist based male homicides, not because they don’t happen, but because the system refuses to document them. This is straight-up erasure, driven by the same gynocentric double standard.

Countries like Mexico, Argentina, and Spain have specific femicide laws, categorizing murders of women due to their gender as a distinct crime with harsher penalties. For example, Mexico’s femicide laws in 2007 can carry sentences up to like 60 years, higher than standard homicide. The UK’s 2021 Domestic Abuse Act also emphasizes gendered violence against women, with no parallel for men.

There’s zero equivalent for misandrist based killings. Homicides of men, even when motivated by anti-male hatred like Joanna Dennehy’s 2013 murders, are just rolled into “general homicide.” No special label, no extra outrage. The FBI’s UCR data in 2022 shows 6,173 male homicide victims in the US compared to 1,849 female victims, yet femicides get the spotlight because they’re tied to “identity.” This is deliberate, labeling femicide as a unique crime amplifies the “women as victims” narrative while ignoring men.

The lack of data on misandrist killings isn’t proof they don’t exist it’s proof of bias. Without a category, these crimes are invisible.

Imagine if we didn’t track hatecrimes by race or religion, would we say they don’t happen?

The system’s rigged to keep men’s victimization off the radar.

 Femicide laws  themselves stem from misandrist statements like “men are a threat to women,” which carry intent and shape policy. The same misandrist statements like “kill all men” or Harmange’s “I Hate Men”  are also dismissed as “venting,” and their real world impact like potential misandrist killings, gets no documentation. It’s a vicious cycle.

no data, no problem, no accountability.

Female homicide is treated as more significant simply because it’s women. The logic is wild 7,022 total homicides in the US  with 88% of victims being male, yet femicide, a smaller subset mindew, gets special laws, media campaigns, and global outrage. Why? Because it’s “identity based,” as said.

This creates a hierarchy where a woman’s death is a tragedy, but a man’s death is just… Tuesday.

The 2021 Sarah Everard case in the UK sparked nationwide protests and policy changes, with #SheWasJustWalkingHome trending. Valid, horrific case. But when men are killed, like the 3,848 male homicide victims in England or Wales from 2020 -2023 there’s no hashtag, no special law. Why? Because “men aren’t killed for being men,” they say. Except we don’t know misandrist motives aren’t tracked, thanks to the bias, also murder is murder regardless on who or what it's based off of.

“Even murderers it seems feel that killing a woman is worse than killing a man.” 

This is it. Society’s internalized gynocentrism so hard that even criminals know killing a woman brings more heat.

Judges often give lighter sentences for male victims’ murders, reflecting this bias. Male deaths are just less “tragic” in the public eye.

 They dismiss male victims because they’re not the “right” kind of victim. We're both saying, hold everyone accountable, no hierarchy. A life is a life XX or XY doesn’t change the body count.

The femicide narrative“women are being hunted for being women” is weaponized to paint men as the ultimate threat, despite men being the majority of homicide victims  at 88% in the US, and 82% in the UK. The stats don’t support the “huge risk” narrative they keep trying to perpetuate.

In Mexico, a femicide hotspot, the rate was 2.6 per 100,000 women UN Women, 2022. Horrific, yes, but male homicide rates are higher 11.4 per 100,000 men in Mexico. Globally, men are 4x more likely to be murdered

The Media and activists amplify femicide to suggest women are uniquely targeted, ignoring that men face higher overall risk. One 2023 post i remember with 50K likes read, “Women aren’t safe anywhere,” linking to a femicide case. Meanwhile, male victims’ storieslike a 2022 UK case of a man stabbed by his expartner
get no traction. Why? It doesn’t fit the “patriarchal oppression” script.

The narrative paints women as oppressed by a misogynistic system that’s “killing them in droves,” while misandrist killings are erased because documenting them would  swing the pendulum a bit and spark charge on the issue.",3,2025-08-07 11:29:44,True,“Misogyny kills.

n7nhodw,1mjz859,MensRights,MindoverMuddle,">Why does it bother you that women are afraid of men?

Because you’re generalizing an entire population based on the actions of a tiny subset, which is the literal definition of prejudice. If we applied your logic to mothers (since they commit the majority of infant homicides), then society would have to see all mothers as a danger to babies. You’d call that sexist and inhumane, but that’s exactly what you’re doing with men.

You claim women are more likely to be killed in car accidents because crash dummies are “male-shaped.”
Reality Men make up the majority of fatal car accident victims. In the EU, men account for 76% of road deaths while being only 49% of the population. If safety measures were based on risk, they’d focus on men, the group dying more often  not the group with fewer deaths but more “fear” about it.


It's the same for homicide victims 


Globally, men make up the majority of homicide victims, despite  also accounting for majority perpetrators.

Women are just scared of the CHANCE of it happening, again, based off self manufactured paranoia and the need to be a victim of something that isn't affecting you the most.

This pattern repeats everywhere.

With Suicide, men die at far higher rates, women attempt more but survive.

Heart Attacks, Men are more likely to have them, that’s why CPR dummies are usually male. It’s about who’s most at risk, not who yells the loudest.


Medical Gynocentrism is vivid.

 Since the 90s, dosage differences for men and women have been officially recognized FDA 1993. Women actually use more prescription meds than men.

Women have over a dozen contraceptive options,

Combined Oral Contraceptive Pill (COC)
Progestin-Only Pill (POP, Mini-Pill)
Hormonal Intrauterine Device (IUD)
T-shaped device inserted into the uterus
Copper Intrauterine Device (IUD)
Contraceptive Implant
Contraceptive Injection
Vaginal Ring
Contraceptive Patch
Female Condom
Diaphragm
Cervical Cap
Contraceptive Sponges
Spermicide



 men have one, condoms, If medicine was “male-centric,” it would be the other way around.

 Breast cancer campaigns are everywhere. Prostate cancer? You get a finger up the ass and “hope for the best.” Awareness, funding, and research are massively skewed toward female conditions.


You justify discrimination against men by hiding behind fear, fear that’s based on statistical cherry picking and personal paranoia, not actual risk.

I'd reckon it's because women spend more time with infants than men do. Similarly, men drive more miles and are riskier drivers - when the severity of the crash is the same, women are more likely to die or be injured. 

You didn't mention it in this message but women are far more likely to be killed in domestic violence than men. The domestic violence stats thrown around here are often misleading. Obviously all violence is bad, but I think we can agree that murder is the worst of it. ""The percentage of females murdered by an intimate partner was 5 times higher than for males,"" according to Bureau of Justice stats. 

Men committing suicide at higher rates doesn't make me less afraid of men - the opposite. It's part of a pattern of violence and aggression; in the case of suicide, it's internalized. 

I'm all for male birth control - please. I was under the impression that men see birth control as a threat to their virility or they couldn't handle the side effects. IUD insertion is traumatizing - they don't take our pain seriously. Gynecological tools look like torture device. Also, women are seen as the person responsible for all things pregnancy and birth. Childbirth is incredibly dangerous, and again, women's pain is ignored. Just recently they've looked at how some women literally feel their C Sections. After years and years of women saying so. We're constantly seen as ""hysterical."" There's plenty of research and data about female underrepresentation in medical research. The clitoris wasn't even fully studied til like 2005.

We have created this narrative that isn't true. When facts are considered, both are equally as bad. But men as you can see from suicide rates are impacted more. When talking about the emotional aspect of women and how they treat men, it is like society is writing them a free ticket to do what they want.

On top of the emotional abuse, the reality is that women are just as physically aggressive as men. It just goes unreported when it's against a man or the police do not act on it. I have several examples from my personal life.

Taking the man out... Lesbian relationships show higher rates of domestic violence. Here are some stats

43.8% of lesbian women and 61.1% of bisexual women have experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner at some point in their lifetime, as opposed to 35% of heterosexual women.

26% of gay men and 37.3% of bisexual men have experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime, in comparison to 29% of heterosexual men.

Bottom line is that society places different value on men and women which drives a false narrative that men=scary, women=safe.

To answer your question, society needs to adjust to men and women's needs. But not minimize what's happening to either gender. It is sites like Tea or AWDTSG that that continued to drive this narrative by providing an environment where women can talk about the bad men are doing. 

My solution would be to shut down those sites, provide more access to mental health to both genders. Start pushing a narrative that men and women can do harm to each other, but, the majority of both genders are good.",4,2025-08-08 07:37:15,False,“Misogyny kills.

I don't think we should be cutting programs that support men. It's dumb, and I think most feminists would agree that we need stronger social support nets for all people. 

The domestic violence stats are complicated. I'm pretty sure those lesbian/bisexual dv studies don't exclude male perpetrators. And maybe women are just as aggressive? 

But we're not as physically strong, which is the source of fear that we have, that a man can strangle us to death with his bare hands, and there's nothing we can do. Of course, there are outliers, and I'm sure smaller men could be afraid of larger women. But generally, that's not how we're built. That's the dynamic that's scary.

People can walk on eggshells fearing everything and everybody around them. Which seems to be the case with some people. Is that a way to live?

Statistically more African Americans commit violent offenses as a percentage of the population they represent than other races. Does that mean we should fear every African American that we come in contact with?

We have learned that we can't do that with race, so why are we doing it with genders? Why are we stereotyping and grouping a small subset of the population into the whole? Just because of a few bad actors that represent a small portion of the population.

I have been hit in the head by a man before much larger than me but I don't fear men. I have been stalked, assaulted physically and sexually by women but I don't fear women. I have had a gun pointed at me by a black person but I don't fear black people.

As long as there are heterosexual men who would do anything for a little sex, nothing will change.

Outside of the media, women don't give a damn about other women and their problems. On the contrary: They even take a closer look at women. They see through these crocodile tears and ""pick me"" attitude.

Women involuntarily get compassion and attention for their issues from men. Men do not give themselves anything because there is no sexual interest in other men (mostly).

So, women are not responsible for the lack of compassion men receive. Unfortunately, men only have themselves to blame for the current situation.

Gearhart outlines a three-step proposal for female-led social change from her essay, ""The Future–-If There Is One–-is Female"":

I) Every culture must begin to affirm a female future

.II) Species responsibility must be returned to women in every culture.

III) **The proportion of men must be reduced to and maintained at approximately 10% of the human race.**

Gearhart does not base this radical proposal on the idea that men are innately violent or oppressive, but rather on the ""real danger is in the phenomenon of male-bonding, that commitment of groups of men to each other whether in an army, a gang, a service club, a lodge, a monastic order, a corporation, or a competitive sport."" Gearhart identifies the self-perpetuating, male-exclusive reinforcement of power within these groups as corrosive to female-led social change. Thus, if ""men were reduced in number, the threat would not be so great and the placement of species responsibility with the female would be assured.""""",15,2025-08-08 00:12:03,True,What is the manosphere and why should we care? | UN Women – Headquarters,161,2025-08-07 06:40:50,28,,,,,,[]

These movements began by elevating women but have since turned to simultaneously attacking the foundations of family and reproduction, framing them as threats to individual empowerment and as obstacles to economic viability within a career. This shift has occurred regardless of the generational loss it creates, as newer generations of workers are no longer emerging from within the heart of the West. Instead, birth and family formation have increasingly been outsourced to countries untouched by this inhumane third or fourth wave of what has ironically now become disempowering for women, for men, and for humanity as a whole. These new waves could be more accurately described as Deconstructive Individualism. The widespread indoctrination to react defensively to any critique, often framing it as a threat to one’s gender identity or societal role, has been deeply embedded by design, reinforced through economic incentives that fund and sustain the movement’s influence.

What that idea does prove beyond a shadow of a doubt, however, is that it's not the opposite sex in general to blame (though blaming the same sex is also wrong), and that is most definitely relevant to combat many forms of feminist rhetoric which go on to blame men for such things, either directly or under the guise of ""toxic masculinity"" and ""patriarchy"". The violent crime argument also tends to miss the context that men, especially black men, are treated much worse by the justice system for the same crimes, meaning one shouldn't inherently trust offender statistics from such institutions, as they are intrinsically tainted by double standards.

n78af7t,1miy4m1,MensRights,63daddy,"Paternity fraud is fraud, a fraud that typically involves fairly sizable sums of money.   The real issue behind this story is that paternity fraud is rarely treated as the fraud that it is.  We shouldn’t need special laws for paternity fraud.  All we need to do is treat the perpetrators of paternity fraud as the criminals they are and treat the defrauded men as the victims they are.   

Women who have committed paternity fraud should face the same criminal charges and sentencing anyone defrauding such amounts would.

n7bc6sm,1miy4m1,MensRights,-1984-Equals-1776-,"Should become standard all over the world.


Although, I've said this before and I'll say it again. The punishment for false paternity should be equivalent to the age of the child, up to a maximum of 18 years. If for example the child is 11 when the fraud is discovered, then she defrauded him of 11 years of his life, 11 years of his financial earning potential, and 11 years during which he could have fathered biological children, and therefore she should face 11 years of her life behind bars. Women will cry injustice at this, but it is actually completely just, and very balanced. And if you don't want equal justice rearing it's head at you, don't be a lying whore, it's fairly straightforward lol.


Although, I strongly advocate paternity testing at birth as a standard practice, for legal reasons, you need a valid paternity test to be listed as the father. It's just a good idea, and, if that were the case you wouldn't need these jail sentences. Not only would this very strongly disincentivize women from doing this shit, but the fraud would also be discovered immediately after the child is born. And the man could then walk away clean, or choose to stay, and sign papers saying that he chooses to be listed as the father and will not hold the woman criminally liable in the future.

n74rwyl,1migmls,MensRights,bulimic_squid,"Nick Freitas nailed it. You can't keep pushing down on young men and demonizing them without them having something to say about it. 

Now I'm not gonna pretend the entire manosphere is a good place, but all of us here know it doesn't matter a single bit whether a particular men's space is objectively good or not. Governments are pushing more and more to control online spaces, with things like digital ID, all being sold under the auspices of child safety and the like. 

Places like this Reddit, online dad's groups, and groups set up to specifically help me in the family courts and the like, will ALL get labelled as the worst spaces - even the ones that support men. Any men's space will get labelled as extremism, and closed down or restricted, once again under the banner of improving safety for women. You can sell any idea to society if you hide it behind something that sounds noble.

It's always been about making men quiet and compliant, because we are the one group that is capable of physically imposing our will on society.

But like Nick said, at some point something will galvanize young men, and depending on what that leadership looks like we could end up with a generation of young men with the strength to have healthy boundaries - or one that is just itching to lash out at the ones who pushed them for so long, and using that strength for revenge.

I know which one I'd like to see, but I also know which one is far, far more likely if things don't change soon.

Ultimately, it's up to men like us to ensure our young men and boys are getting the right messages. Be strong but kind. Be firm but fair.   
  
Because brothers, if they aren't getting the right message from us, they'll get the wrong message somewhere else, and then the pendulum swings too far the other way again.

n73sget,1mi8yrr,MensRights,Demonspawn,"There's some important gender differences here that need to be understood in the context of fear and risk.  Men and women do not evaluate risk the same at all.

Men see risk as a gradient; Women see risk as a binary. A man understand that some behavior may increase the risk of something bad happening (e.g. woodwork in flip-flops), but a man can understand the trade-offs involved and make a calculation if the gain (I don't have to go back inside to change footwear) are worth the risks (dropping something on my feet).  A man is capable of deciding if that risk is worth it in case A (small project) but also not worth it in case B (bigger parts).

Women see risk as a dichotomy between ""safe"" (having taken all precautions) and ""not safe"" (missing one or more precautions).  That's it.  Either nothing bad can happen, or something bad will most likely happen.  That's why you will watch women argue against X being a risk factor because they don't want to have to ""be safe"" by avoiding X.  It's a cost too high for them, so X has to not be a factor or else they'd be not safe.

Yes, there's exceptions to this generalization on both sides, but let's play out an example from the norms.

n769w98,1mi8yrr,MensRights,pancakecel,"Well personally in the country that I live in, women go to jail for having abortions, and there is no exception for rape or incest, or when a mother's life is at risk. On top of that, women are often sent to jail for miscarriages or stillbirths if it is perceived that they may have done something to provoke it, even without conclusive proof that they did so.

Teenage pregnancy, which is often due to forced unions or coercion, is an issue. I've heard the statistic that one in five babies are born to girls 19 or under, and I think that statistic might be a little bit outdated, but it's definitely happening more than I would like to happen. 

Women are also disproportionately affected by diseases like anemia, certain autoimmune disorders like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, and of course breast cancer. This isn't specifically true to El salvador, these are problems for women the world over. 

I don't have data on this, but from what I can tell from my own friends in the industry, I think that the situations in which female prostitutes operate are a little bit more vulnerable than the situations in which male prostitutes operate. Prostitution is legal in El salvador. For male prostitutes, it's an option to meet clients in a place like a gay spa, which is pretty safe. There isn't really an equivalent of that where female prostitutes can meet or take clients. So they end up working out of their homes or going with clients to hotels, both of which are riskier in my opinion. 

Across the way in Guatemala, in the indigenous communities about 70% of men can read but only about 40% of women can, which isn't great.

Personally for me, the number one thing I'm worried about is breast cancer.  My chance of getting breast cancer is one in nine. I don't really walk around being worried about getting murdered by a stranger because the likelihood of that happening is less than one in a thousand, by a long way actually. It's perplexing to me the assertion that I should be walking around thinking about whether or not I'm going to get murdered by a stranger.

The weird thing is that there has actually been more awareness of the need for moral consideration for decapod crustaceans than insects, even though decapods actually have simpler brains. If you recognise the need to protect decapod welfare, there's no real reason not to oppose the unnecessary killing of insects.


I suppose this may be due to the fallacy of thinking big things matter more. So people tend to put more value on the lives and welfare of big animals than small ones, and decapods are often bigger than insects.

Link you to a few examples of my real-life experiences of women expressing the sentiment I quoted? Sure bud.

n7arwr1,1mi8yrr,MensRights,pancakecel,"Hi! The reason that I said ''personally for me what I worry about is breast cancer'' is because that's what I personally worry about, for myself. I personally worry about that specific cancer because I have a one in nine chance of getting it. I didn't mean to communicate the idea but men don't get cancer, and that men don't worry about cancer. I do understand that men get cancer and that men worry about cancer. One of my male family members died of cancer pretty early in life.

I was trying to express a contrast between the things that society insists that women constantly worry about (i.e, being victims of violence), in contrast with what I actually worry about, that being the breast cancer.

I was also trying to contrast the difference between what I feel like people are always telling me is going to kill me (men) and what actually is way way more likely to kill me (breast cancer, cars). 

My original comment was expressing the idea that the constant fever pitch of worry about what men might do not only harms men, but it also distracts women from  things that are much more likely to harm them. I personally feel that I hear a lot more dialogue about men being dangerous and how I need to watch out for men, and a lot less messaging about things that are statistically much more likely to kill me than a man, like cancer, an unhealthy diet, or a car. I'm four times more likely to die of cancer than I am to die of homicide in my 30s. Also, I feel like it is a real possibility for cancer to be eliminated, and it's an unrealistic possibility for men to be eliminated (and ethically dubious in my opinion).

n783iie,1miw1cl,MensRights,Same_Sentence_3470,"Around 20 years ago I started noticing how nearly every movie, series, and advertisements were made for women. I  worked 17 years at a large medical university where nearly the entire management from the top down was women. The double standards on the expectations for male employee’s vs female were unbelievable. I got divorced 15 years ago and realized how unfair divorce is to men and when I started trying to date realized that it was nearly impossible for men to meet women and how incredibly easy it was for women to meet men.

The topic that brought me to Men’s Rights was last fall when the NFL announced that the players wanted to change the locker room policy because it had become so invasive. I started researching why the players don’t have a right to their own privacy. I also started noticing the incredible number of women that have unrestricted access to men’s locker rooms. The truth is men don’t have the right to privacy. When a  women wants to invade that privacy nothing is done. And in the case of the NFL the women who invade the privacy  of the athletes are considered heroes and at the same time victims for having to do their job in a men’s  locker room although they probably chose that career for that perk.  The other thing that happened last fall that brought me to Men’s Rights was a TV show that was televised in the US called The Full Monty. The show was advertised as a way to raise awareness for prostate and testicular cancer. The show was about 6 good lucking celebrity men getting fully naked in front of a live audience of women and televising it on public TV. I thought it was completely appalling that they would use men’s cancers as an excuse to televise a show that was entirely meant for the entertainment of women. I don’t have a problem with nudity and I don’t care what women find entertaining.  But this was about the most degrading thing that you could do to a man with prostate or testicular cancer. It was purely for the entertainment of women at the expense of men that have cancer and I doubt that they raised  any awareness or money for men’s cancers.",11,2025-08-06 06:00:53,False,How did you discover the “Manosphere”?,22,2025-08-05 22:16:06,66,,,,,,[]

The problem is a lot of the ""manosphere"" content can send guys down some pretty dark paths that don't actually help them become better men or have better relationships.



The guys I work with who do best focus less on ""what women want"" and more on becoming the kind of man they respect. They work on their communication, their boundaries, their emotional intelligence. They stop trying to fix or control their partner and start focusing on what they can actually control - themselves.



NMMNG has some good insights but it can also lead guys toward resentment if they're not careful. The key is taking the useful stuff (like learning to set boundaries and stop people-pleasing) without falling into the trap of thinking all women are manipulative or that relationships are some kind of game to win.

n72mk23,1micfxh,MensRights,Starforce2005,"Because men are viewed as 'asset' to women, men belong to women, so if the asset is destroyed, the asset owner is the victim, that is the simple logic behind these claim. Like when your hammer breaks, you wouldn't call the hammer victim, you are the one that 'lost' the hammer.

In fact, many women especially those women with so called 'traditional value' think this way covertly, men are their assets.

The most dehumanizing concept are with men everyday, everywhere, but men internalize these concept as honor, duty, or even masculinity, which gave them dopamine hit, these dopamine hit are not just isolated to that man, its like a virus, he soon start enforce that virus onto other men. He start policing other men to be sacrificial for women, but sooner or later when he realize society treats him like shit, he start to complain but never realize himself was the problem all along is most ironic and tragic thing in modern society.

\--- --- --- ---

Edit (skip this section use the above as TLDR if you think its too verbose): from a DM request I want to share something from the perspective of a woman to further demonstrate the seeing men as 'asset' part, and why we see ourselves as 'victim'.

**Imaging you are a woman**, from the moment you realize you grow your breast (and a little bit of make up, trust me you don't have to look like a model, somewhere around average is enough), you find so many men are attracted to you (it does has its share of downside of course), you have a huge pool of mate to choose from, at first you believe in love or whatever other nonsense the consumerism tells you to believe. But after few relationship (which are free to try unlike for men), soon you will realize all men are the same, love is an illusion, but you also find out that there is a glitch, you don't really have to work (of course you have the choice but its no longer a requirement), men are dying to provide for you. And later you find more glitches, you learn how marriage really works, it gets you access to at least half of the assets (sometimes up to 70%) from another person's entire saving (and alimony), you also find out that having a child gets you child support (this part I can't truly experience unfortunate), now how will you see men? What happen if your men dies in war? You get pensions as his family member! Finding a new men is also very easy, many women (covertly) think finding new dates are equivalent to shopping for cloth (most women don't actually hate men, but they do see men being pathetic). But none of these you can openly admit or let alone discuss them, not to mention other women will police the heck out of you, so you see necessity for female only space? Do you really think female only space exist to only fend off SA (it would be ridiculous if that's the ONLY thing you discuss 7/24)? Do you really believe the type of thing you see in FDS only happens on reddit (and why banning it makes absolutely no difference)? Do you see why many women see male only space as a treat?

You might be asking, damn, how is society this unfair? Because men are so self unaware, so driven by ego and pride they lost touch with reality (nobody is going to fight for your rights other than yourself), for those minority that do become self aware (like this subreddit), they threaten the entire system (that exploit them), they threaten those that work in the academia (publishing countless studies and thrive on female victimhood), they threatens the NGOs and the lobbyist (who gets their entire fund based on advocating for a certain victim group), they threaten all the staff that work in legal system (such as these that benefit from Title-IV-D), they threaten the consumerism that sustain the current society, these 'middlemen' have every incentive to silence you, its not that they hate you, on the contrary they **love** you, but in a way that you are the chicken who lay eggs, you are the cow that gets milked dry. The  'middlemen' is not some conspiracy theory, its just that profiting off male GDPs are so lucrative! They 'love' you so much they will never let you go, like a toxic relationship.

When you see the casualties in the recent war, and having discussion from the perspective of nationalism or patriotism, the pathetic sentiment of ""but, but, but, if we don't go to war, our nation collapses"", women on the other hand figure that out long time ago, *“As a woman, I have no country. As a woman, I want no country. As a woman, my country is the whole world”* \- Virginia Woolf

Men and boys are so groomed into believe that conscription is a duty, an honor, a proof of masculinity, but in reality its a mix of state forced human trafficking, state forced enslavement, state forced mass murder, not to mention grooming or trafficking kids (boys of course) barely 15 into meat grinder is not uncommon in human history (even in modern world it still exists, using child soldier to charge minefield is not something new). It does nothing but to profit the elite and politician from both side whom live under completely different rules to your average men. The lower caste male is a victim in practice but without the name, a silent victim without the victim status, a status that become a caste system on its own, a status men can never have. What men gets is the honor (dopamine hit) of being a 'combatant', a combatant is someone that is considered ethical to be killed, someone does not count as victim of war, someone who gets to be blamed for 'men and their stupid violent wars, pfft!'

Of course women are human as well, human have compassion (towards men), honey badger exist for a reason, its just that the world is so tempting I don't believe if the role were reversed most men can resist that temptation any better save for a few.

Social conditioning is the reason, not biology, in a thought experiment if every men stop mating, egg does not get fertilize on its own, to eliminate male disposability, men themselves needs to change, and become self aware.

Women in general are experts on creating artificial female scarcity, if you spent at least sometime in female space you would understand how many of this scarcity is achieved by women encouraging or even policing other women, and how much they wanted to ban porn and any other alternatives (such as robots or toys for men) that they see as a competition to the scarcity they created, they are the professional when it comes to manipulating supply & demand in the mating market. When men are spending their time on video games, sports, or porn, women are reading psychology, gender studies, female oriented magazines, dating strategies, doing cosmetics, learning male behaviors, manipulating male egos, etc.

The fact that male disposability are so internalized by men at this point they forgot the very concept that 'one men fertilize many women thus men are disposable' concept was first introduce by a feminist. The reality is, anything but, if you look at other mammals, male and female population are about the same without artificial interventions. Both men and women cannot create life on its own, its an objective fact.

Often time when you hear someone saying stuff like ""in the time of crisis government coerce men to war because men are disposable by biology"", but when you ask the very same person ""then why in the time of crisis, women were never 'conscripted' into incubation chambers"" he will likely begin strawmaning by point to anything else but biology which he so firmly believe in the first place. If someone believe biological essentialism so much then why the double standards? why not double down on both sex?

Not to mention one men fertilizing multiple women are terrible for the gene pool (equivalent to incest within few generation, a single virus can wipe out a huge population, trust me COVID wouldn't be the same), which defeats the very purpose of sexual reproduction that evolved from Parthenogenesis.

In complex creatures like us reproduction is relatively less important than survival (r-selection vs K-selection) because our offspring need a lot of time to grow and that's where the physical strenght, protection, ingenuity (also thanks to male variability) come in.

The super pro-choice women become angry when hearing a woman say even if her child is an accident she is still keeping it. Or getting angry abortion wasn't given as an option in a sitcom.

The ""all bodies are beautiful"" women grow very angry when you say they are starting to look like their fat friend. Or if you say a dress is making her look fat.

Say they don't care about traditions and want to dismantle gender roles until it comes time for her to ask the guy out, pay, propose or do anything expected of men. All of a sudden their likes just happen to copy tradition.

Say they are more than incubators yet when asked what they bring to the table, why they shouldn't be drafted, why she deserves extra privileges, why they feel entitled to his money/attention, why he should get a vasectomy rather than her sterilising herself they always somehow manage to bring up pregnancy. I find it hilarious because there's so much more they can say and give but all they will say is some variation of ""she got pregnant"". That's all they belittle their worth down to. 

Say they are pro-lgbt but when it comes time to insult a man they accuse him of being gay. If he mistreated her, he's gay. If he doesn't succumb to her outrageous standards he's gay. If he rejects her he's gay.

Women get shamed from a variety of sources.  For years she never studied men.  When she did, she found men rarely shame other men.  Men's shame comes almost exclusively from women and almost exclusively from women's perceptions of men being weak.

'Toxic masculinity' includes 'not showing weakness'.  I think 'toxic masculinity' is better framed as women shaming men and women having toxic femininity.

If women suppress men talking about issues, then the only issues that will be discussed are women's issues.  This is the matriarchy asserting itself.

“Here’s the painful pattern that emerged from my research with men: We ask them to be vulnerable, we beg them to let us in, and we plead with them to tell us when they’re afraid, but the truth is that most women can’t stomach it. In those moments when real vulnerability happens in men, most of us recoil with fear and that fear manifests as everything from disappointment to disgust. And men are very smart. They know the risks, and they see the look in our eyes when we’re thinking, C’mon! Pull it together. Man up. As Joe Reynolds, one of my mentors and the dean at our church, once told me during a conversation about men, shame, and vulnerability, “Men know what women really want. They want us to pretend to be vulnerable. We get really good at pretending.” -- Brené Brown

Gotta let this things go. In my mind, someone that actually believes that a bear is safer than the average man is paranoid. Not just saying it for tiktok, but actually believing it, has the medical condition of paranoia. So I feel bad for what has led them to that conclusion.

Making a counter to the bear question is not going to make anybody feel safer around men. Nor is it our job to go out of our way to make everybody feel extra safe. 

There's a reason these types of things spread like a virus online between women. Their brains look for slight hints of danger and steer them away from anything. It's the same phenomenon for ""ick"" videos and ""red flag"" videos. Women eat that up. 

Men would rather share their feelings to a tree than even their wives.

>The results were surprising. For example, the **CDC's nationally representative data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators.** Over their lifetime, **79 percent of men who were ""made to penetrate"" someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators**. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators.

#

>We also pooled four years of the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data and found that 80% of male victims who experienced rape or sexual assault reported at least one female perpetrator. **Among those who were raped or sexually assaulted by a woman, 58% of male victims and 41% of female victims reported that the incident involved a violent attack, meaning the female perpetrator hit, knocked down or otherwise attacked the victim, many of whom reported injuries.**

>**The final outrage in Stemple and Meyer's paper involves inmates, who aren't counted in the general statistics at all.** In the last few years, the BJS did two studies in adult prisons, jails, and juvenile facilities. The surveys were excellent because they afforded lots of privacy and asked questions using very specific, informal, and graphic language. (""Did another inmate use physical force to make you give or receive a blow job?"") **Those surveys turned up the opposite of what we generally think is true. Women were more likely to be abused by fellow female inmates, and men by guards, and many of those guards were female. For example, of juveniles reporting staff sexual misconduct, 89 percent were boys reporting abuse by a female staff member.** In total, inmates reported an astronomical 900,000 incidents of sexual abuse.

':](https://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers/)

>For many feminists, questioning claims of rampant sexual violence in our society amounts to misogynist ""rape denial."" However, **if the CDC figures are to be taken at face value, then we must also conclude that, far from being a product of patriarchal violence against women, ""rape culture"" is a two-way street, with plenty of female perpetrators and male victims.**
>
>How could that be? After all, very few men in the CDC study were classified as victims of rape: 1.7 percent in their lifetime, and too few for a reliable estimate in the past year. But these numbers refer only to men who have been forced into anal sex or made to perform oral sex on another male. **Nearly 7 percent of men, however, reported that at some point in their lives, they were ""made to penetrate"" another person**—usually in reference to vaginal intercourse, receiving oral sex, or performing oral sex on a woman. **This was not classified as rape, but as ""other sexual violence.""**
#
>And now the real surprise: when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being ""made to penetrate""—either by physical force or due to intoxication—at virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).
#
>In other words, **if being made to penetrate someone was counted as rape—and why shouldn’t it be?—then the headlines could have focused on a truly sensational CDC finding: that women rape men as often as men rape women.**
#
>The CDC also reports that men account for over a third of those experiencing another form of sexual violence—""sexual coercion."" That was defined as being pressured into sexual activity by psychological means: lies or false promises, threats to end a relationship or spread negative gossip, or ""making repeated requests"" for sex and expressing unhappiness at being turned down.

Just think of something simple as how many women make it the biggest deal if a toilet seat is up. Are there any men that talk like outrageous of always having to put the toilet seat up. Just as a meaningless exemple.

How one side always makes something seem much bigger then it is.

And most men that do push it and put a mirror on women's face. They often have no really big emotions while they do it they just want to treat people how people treat them. With the same wide brushes and the blame by association.

Men mostly are a lot less emotional and dont really react or talk about it they just walk away while they have a feeling of discust for those people. Men are a lot more of few words and more actions.

Why im not all that surprised backlash trends dont get seen or picked up by other men.

Similar to the sprinkle, sprinkle. Trend women had men had a drizzle, drizzle. Backlash movement. They not serious at all just pointing and laughing how dumb and stupid women are acting and how unworthy they are to being taken seriously. In a way that is poring salt where it hurt thee feeling same way it hurts men. And the same way how it triggers a amount of discust in men for how women talk and act with wide brushes. Doing the same thing to those women back.

Basically showing how big of a clown they are by playing by there same weird outrageous rules and claims in return on them. In a way that hurt them.

Honestly its the best way to deal with it being forced to ground people expectations by being how people are too you. A simple skill not learned much by single mom parent holds. Why its such a big problem to begin with. But a important skill to learn how your actions reflects back at you and also effects the outcomes you might get. A skill often learned by very involved father's with there children. And a viable skill needed as a adult. And to have to be able to have functional relationships. The lack off makes why many relationships are like fast food. All lust and lack of substance beside that simple fact cause there transactional in nature. What love normally not is.

['There Is Still No Women's Health Crisis'](https://jameslnuzzo.substack.com/p/there-is-still-no-womens-health-crisis)

>These days, it is not too difficult to find an academic paper or news article that states that women are ""underrepresented"" as participants in medical research trials. In fact, in this week's press release from the White House, in which it announced the creation of a White House Initiative on Women's Health Research, the underrepresentation of women as participants in health research was mentioned in the press release's first sentence.
>
>By underrepresented, authors mean that women are being excluded from participating in research studies, or that researchers are not taking an interest in women's health issues. This supposed exclusion of women from research is then thought to cause a lack of knowledge of how the female body works and how women might react to certain medical interventions differently than men.
>
>The continued claim that women are not adequately represented in biomedical research is strange given that in 1990 federal legislation created the Office for Research on Women's Health within the National Institutes of Health, or NIH. One of the main reasons the office was created was to ensure that women were equally represented as participants in clinical trials. In fact, the original claim that women were not equally represented in such research – the claim that led to the creation of the Office for Research on Women’s Health – was debunked in 1994 in a report generated by the Institute of Medicine. Moreover, in 1998, Sally Satel published an article titled, ""There is no women's health crisis,"" in which Satel described the history of false assumptions about women's health research in the US, including the false or questionable claims that women were underrepresented as participants in clinical research and that women's health issues were not receiving adequate attention.
>
>Nevertheless, the Office for Research on Women's Health still exists today, and one of its main aims is still the inclusion of women as participants in clinical trials. In fact, there exist multiple offices within the US government dedicated to women's health, and the White House's Initiative on Women's Health Research is set to establish several more offices. Meanwhile, no office for research on men's health has ever been created within the US government; a strange omission given that life expectancy for men in the US is six years shorter than for women.

#

>For the administrative branch of the US government to declare another initiative for women's health research and more women's health offices is neither objective nor just. It is perhaps the result of the human biological inclination for helping and protecting women which is then jacked up on feminist and gender politics steroids. The US is not alone in this issue of gynocentrism impacting the public health agenda. In Australia, for example, where life expectancy for males is 4 years shorter than for females, the country's national health body allocates about $88 million Australian dollars each year for women's health research compared to $17.5 million dollars each year for research on men's health.
>
>As there already exist multiple national health offices for research on women’s health, this week's announcement by the White House for an Initiative on Women's Health Research suggests a sort of national emergency to address women's health issues. But the epidemiological data do not support this position. Sally Satel astutely observed in 1998 that there was no women’s health crisis. Twenty-five years later, I am here to tell you that there is still no women's health crisis.

>What about all the new drug tests that exclude women? Don't they prove the pharmaceutical industry's insensitivity to and disregard for females?
>
>The Food and Drug Administration divides human testing of new medicines into three stages. Phase 1 studies are done on a small number of volunteers over a brief period of time, primarily to test safety. Phase 2 studies typically involve a few hundred patients and are designed to look more closely at safety and effectiveness. Phase 3 tests precede approval for commercial release and generally include several thousand patients.
>
>In 1977 the FDA issued guidelines that specifically excluded women with ""childbearing potential"" from phase 1 and early phase 2 studies; they were to be included in late phase 2 and phase 3 trials in proportion to their expected use of the medication."" But: ""FDA surveys conducted in 1983 and 1988 showed that the two sexes had been proportionally represented in clinical trials by the time drugs were approved for release.
>
>The 1977 guidelines codified a policy already informally in effect since the thalidomide tragedy shocked the world in 1962. The births of armless or otherwise deformed babies in that era dramatically highlighted the special risks incurred when fertile women ingest drugs. So the policy of excluding such women from the early phases of drug testing arose out of concern, not out of disregard, for them. The policy was changed last year, as a consequence of political protest and recognition that early studies in both sexes might better direct testing.

#

>To remedy the alleged neglect, an Office of Research on Women's Health was established by the NIH in 1990. In 1991 the NIH launched its largest epidemiological project ever, the Women's Health Initiative. Costing more than $600 million, this fifteen-year program will study the effects of estrogen therapy, diet, dietary supplements, and exercise on heart disease, breast cancer, colon cancer, osteoporosis, and other diseases in 160,000 postmenopausal women. The study is ambitious in scope and may well result in many advances in the care of older women.
>
>What it will not do is close the ""medical gender gap,"" the difference in the quality of care given the two sexes. The reason is that the gap does not favor men. As we have seen, women receive more medical care and benefit more from medical research. The net result is the most important gap of all: seven years, 10 percent of life.

['Did Medical Research Routinely Exclude Women? An Examination of the Evidence'](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Fulltext/2001/09000/Did_Medical_Research_Routinely_Exclude_Women__An.20.aspx)

>These analyses indicate that before 1990, women routinely participated in clinical trials, and in numbers that are more than proportionate to the number of women in the overall population. Although these analyses of clinical trials appear to be persuasive, they leave unanswered the question of female participation in epidemiologic research.

#

>During this time frame, 13,119 of the published epidemiologic studies included men, and 15,193 studies included women. These numbers represent a 15.8% difference favoring women. ... Overall, the total number of clinical trials favored women by a 26.5% margin, an even greater disparity than that noted for the Medline analysis of epidemiologic studies.

#

>In 1994, the first year in which the tracking system was operational, men were found to represent 44.9% of enrollees in extramural research, women 51.8%, and the sex of the remaining 3.3% was unknown. By 1994, male participation had fallen to 32.2%. 11 Numerically, 1,501,687 fewer males than females were enrolled in NIH extramural research in 1997.

#

>The percentage decline in male enrollments appears to be associated with the growth in female-only protocols. In 1994, the NIH sponsored 95 male-only studies, and 219 female-only studies. 12 By 1997, the disparity had widened to 244 all-male studies vs. 740 all-female studies. 13 Based on data provided by the NIH_Office of External Research, the 1997 single-sex studies enrolled 85,901 males and 1,264,381 females. This difference of 1,178,480 persons accounts for much of the overall NIH shortfall in male enrollment.

#

>A review of sex-specific enrollments in medical research studies, and an examination of the number of epidemiologic studies and clinical trials that included men and women, point to two conclusions: 1) Historically, women were routinely included in medical research, and 2) Women have participated in medical research in numbers at least proportionate to the overall female population.",72,2025-08-04 18:32:20,False,"Gates Foundation ignores men's health, commits $2.5 billion to 'ignored' women's health",654,2025-08-04 16:39:01,109,,,,,,[]

Men more often get stuck with society’s most dangerous jobs and make up more than 90% of workplace fatalities, more than 90% of bystander interventions, and the vast majority of suicides.

You’ll see that commentary in the media overwhelmingly focuses on promoting women’s health, while those who promote men’s health are mocked, harassed, and silenced. Men who are suffering often get victim blamed.

Supporting evidence on the lack of attention to men’s health is here in an article by Richard Reeves, ""Men are having a health crisis. Why aren’t we paying attention?"":

Dumb argument. the fact that women live very bad lives in poor countries with muslim culture (which europe wants to adopt but that's another topic) doesn't change the fact that we're often discriminating men in the US and Europe. 

I live in Poland, and here women retire earlier, get better educational opportinities, have it easier in a bunch of physical jobs and our centre-left goverment is slowly pushing out the whole ""giving women jobs just because they're women"" thing. Also if you're a Polish father after divorce there's a 0% chance you're getting the kid and you might also pay alimony not just for the kid, but for the wife too, even if she works and has a stable situation. 

There's also the cultural stuff that you also have in the west, like easier dating ect.

I can guarantee that your country has most of the problems I listed above for Poland.

> ""Men have been subject to systematic neglect in terms of global policy and funding, despite their disproportionate morbidity and mortality burdens from a wide range of gendered health problems. When there have been gender-specific recommendations, the target beneficiary group has been women. National women's health policies have been introduced for England and Scotland, in August 2022, and August 2021, respectively, but there are currently no plans to introduce equivalent policies for men. A review of interventions, services, and programmes in sub-Saharan Africa found that men's specific needs are neglected and their engagement with health services is not encouraged unless the aim is to improve women's health, for example in relation to HIV or sexual and reproductive health issues.""

> ""Men significantly delay seeking treatment for mental health (6–8 years for mood disorders, 9–23 years for anxiety). That delay isn’t carelessness, it’s rooted in shame, stigma, and lack of gender-sensitive resources.""

[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1447822/)

Stigma keeps men from seeking help. After heart attacks or strokes, men are significantly less likely than women to use primary healthcare services, delaying treatment, not by choice, but because admitting vulnerability is often seen as weakness among men.

There’s still no national men’s health strategy despite the large gap. Men in deprived regions of England live up to 10 years shorter than women in affluent areas, yet there’s still no targeted national intervention plan. And it’s not just in England, mate...

Think of it like this. If you built up a wall around all women, and men wanted to approach, there would need to be a good reason to get the gates open. But for the men, the majority of men want to go out, so even if we built a wall for men, they'd leave.


As long as men are of the opinion that they need to venture forth, and women are of the opinion they need to be propositioned, the situations that hurt us the most will be repeatable.


Furthermore, men have expectations that are often not waived. Men are expected to protect, serve and provide regardless of if they're in a relationship or not. While women are less encouraged, if at all, to do what they were expected to for just their partners.


In short: The women who hurt these men aren't ever going to see the outcome of their behavior and say, ""Wow we need to do better..."" So the support group for men would be useful, but it will be like this sub, where we support and share our own experiences, but nothing on the outside changes.

n6xgbdk,1mhm4gx,MensRights,Jimithyashford,"There are some places in this world where women are not permitted or expected to be financially independent, when they come of age, they essentially require a caregiver, a marriage is as much a business arrangement as it is out of love, and in many cases it is almost entirely a business arrangement and love has very little to do with it.

I trust you all understand what I'm referring to.

So, in such an environment, the breaking off of an intended marriage can, and historically has, had legal consequences, it's essentially reneging on a business agreement.

The same way that fathers used to be able to sue rapists for the financial loss of the value of their daughter's virginity.

Same way that in some cultures women use to be able to sue their brother in laws and enforce statutes requiring them to marry in the even of their husband's untimely death.

Seems like an odd concept here in the modern west, where we don't view marriage that way. But some parts of the world still do. When you treat women as commodities and as prizes that must be bought and sold or traded and cared for, then this is the kind of thing that comes into play.

It wasn't all that long ago that we still had this sort of thing going on in our country. I know of one instance as recently as the late 1930s here in the US in which a 17 year old who got knocked up out of wedlock was ""sold"" to an old widower who lived up the street to be his bride in settlement of a debt. Now obviously that was all under the table since that kind of this is illegal here, but it's not hard to imagine that in a country where that kind of thing is legal, the old widowers could have been sued for breech of a hand-shake contract if he had backed out.",-18,2025-08-04 12:52:42,False,Indian man arrested for breaking promise of marriage,123,2025-08-04 11:50:14,11,,,,,,[]

I totally understand where you're coming from. But many women are able to just say bye-bye baby without any regard for their partner. So, it seems fitting that men would have the same rights to refuse parental responsibility. Most of the time, they wouldn't be able to exercise it or anything because abortions are the more popular choice. But it will help with any time a man simply doesn't feel ready to be a dad or doesn't want to ruin his life. Or lastly, if the condom fails. Sorta the same reasons most get abortions.

Just an equal playing field if that makes sense.

Same goes for the woman- if she can’t be there emotionally, supportively, protectively and financially, then why would a man want to deal with that AND force her to go through the extreme physical undertaking that pregnancy/childbirth entail?

I cannot imagine going through with a pregnancy if the other parent wanted no part in it, but I’m also an educated person who isn’t blindly following a religious cult. 

I feel like the women who would still go through with it likely lack access to education/resources that provide an ability to understand that alternative options (aka abortion) are okay… or you could try to “trap” a guy to get child support if you’re a literal psycho with no concern for how that dynamic would impact the actual person being born in which case parenthood shouldn’t be the vibe regardless tbh.

There are multiple women in my life who have told me basically that outside a life or death kind of situation they’d never seek an abortion for an unwanted pregnancy. A woman I’ve known since elementary school and who is now a highly educated doctor has told me that if she doesn’t find a husband and a father soon that she wants to just become a single mother to a baby of her own. Those are paths that people can and should be allowed to take in my opinion. 

The one aspect of pregnancy that I’m willing for men to be completely overruled on is the question of whether the pregnancy comes to term at all. It is literally unfair that women (should) get the final say over whether or not to terminate a pregnancy, but it is also literally unfair that women have to bear the pregnancy. Because of that irreconcilable fact of nature, I don’t think that the father to an unplanned pregnancy should be able to overrule a woman’s decisions with respect to whether or not the pregnancy is terminated. 

But I also believe that for as long as a mother would have the option to terminate the pregnancy, the father should have the option of choosing to decline legal responsibility for the child.

n6yt78t,1mhbauy,MensRights,mrmensplights,"There are certain rhetorical constructs that let the people who use them 'move the goal posts'. Toxic masculinity is one of them. 

In normal use of the term they will refer to all masculine traits as toxic and men as toxic and hold up the feminine as a rule. Men are bad. Male oriented behaviors are bad.  If you challenge them - and they don't have the mob on their side - then *only then* do they fall back and say it's it refers to cultural norms associated with traditional male behavior that are harmful. such as emotional suppression, dominance, aggression, or devaluation of perceived weakness. They take the badness of these traits as self evident when in reality each are all positive in the right context and to the right proportion.

Here it becomes evident: By going after 'traditional' behaviors and assuming they represent 'negative traits' what they are actually doing is applying a new progressive gender norm on men by demonizing traditional and conservative traits. It's a political tool. If you challenge them saying ""then where is toxic femininity"" they'll claim it does exist. You've never seen it used in your life but it exists as a kind of escape hatch for toxic masculinity. However, the political angle becomes even more evident when you look up the definition: ""toxic femininity is a form of internalised misogyny which involves restricting yourself to stereotypically feminine behaviors in order to appeal to men"". This should complete the picture.

Changing the term 'toxic masculinity' to something else would be nice - but it doesn't change the underlying issues. These traits are not necessarily bad. These traits come naturally to many men and demonizing them is demonizing maleness: A lot of this toxic masculinity talk is just ""treating boys as defective girls"". For example, testosterone is linked to increased emotional control and reduced emotional expressiveness and it also inhibits emotional crying. Men are tougher than women and tend to exhibit higher levels of aggression, risk taking, and competitiveness. We should fight to free men of expectations related to these norms but demonizing these traits while doing is so throwing the baby out with the bath water. We shouldn't demonize these typical and positive traits just because some men don't conform - instead let's create a new paradigm where all men are accepted regardless. 

While changing the messaging away from toxic masculinity and focusing on compassion instead of hostility is a good approach, it doesn't change the underlying problem. Toxic masculinity itself is just a symptom of the disease. While women live a kind of double standard of gender norms where they adopt traditional traits when it suits them and progressive traits when it suits them. Men don't have this freedom. When men cry or have mental health issues they generally viewed with disdain and even *dangerous*. If a man cries at work or takes mental health days or defers people will feel uncomfortable and management will apply an 'unstable' label and they will not be considered them for advancement. In dating women still expect men to fulfill traditional gender roles and norms, and still demand men sacrifice themselves and orient around service. It's not a problem men can solve by themselves and so a more positive marketing spin alone can't fix it.

TLDR: Yes, toxic masculinity is a cruel weapon, inherently political, negative and needs to go. Yes we should work to allow men to live without feeling pressured or enforced to specific norms or traits. However, we should not demonize these norms and traits either. And we should acknowledge this is a drop in the ocean of a complex problem that extends to men's interactions with every facet of society and can't be fixed by focusing on male behavior alone.",3,2025-08-04 17:08:31,False,"I feel like more men would be happier to break free from gender expectations if we change the terminology surrounding ""toxic masculinity"".",222,2025-08-04 04:51:48,92,,,,,,[]

Of course, not all traditional expectations of male gender expression and roles fall under the “macho man” umbrella. And “macho” would need to be construed broadly, beyond the basic “tough guy” or “he-man” stereotypes. Think of the suave debonair movie archetype as an alternate form. 

Other authors have written about being constrained by the “man box”. 

The whole alpha - beta - omega - sigma thing is an attempt at a typology, but it’s also a value judgement, used to denigrate.

[Dr. Brene Brown](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6497971-here-s-the-painful-pattern-that-emerged-from-my-research-with) was a feminist sociologist who studied shame--the negative feeling you get when someone criticizes you--""you should be ashamed"".  Women get shamed from a variety of sources.  For years she never studied men.  When she did, she found men rarely shame other men.  Men's shame comes almost exclusively from women and almost exclusively from women's perceptions of men being weak.

'Toxic masculinity' includes 'not showing weakness'.  I think 'toxic masculinity' is better framed as women shaming men and women having toxic femininity.

If women suppress men talking about issues, then the only issues that will be discussed are women's issues.  This is the matriarchy asserting itself.

https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/frj4np/how_brene_brown_discovered_that_male_shame_was/

“Here’s the painful pattern that emerged from my research with men: We ask them to be vulnerable, we beg them to let us in, and we plead with them to tell us when they’re afraid, but the truth is that most women can’t stomach it. In those moments when real vulnerability happens in men, most of us recoil with fear and that fear manifests as everything from disappointment to disgust. And men are very smart. They know the risks, and they see the look in our eyes when we’re thinking, C’mon! Pull it together. Man up. As Joe Reynolds, one of my mentors and the dean at our church, once told me during a conversation about men, shame, and vulnerability, “Men know what women really want. They want us to pretend to be vulnerable. We get really good at pretending.” -- Brené Brown

n6vac5a,1mhbauy,MensRights,Demonspawn,"Women have always been attracted to the leader, the alpha, and even the rogue bad guy. Always.

It's just that before women's suffrage changed our government to the point where women could get men's resources from men without having to keep the man's commitment by pleasing him, these men were big risks for the woman to pursue. Sure, the alpha guy would fuck her, but would he stick around to support her children? As such, the woman's rational brains would temper these drives and impulses such that only women with poor impulse control would actively pursue these men.

The rules have changed now, and the boundary case is the majority of women (boundary case: those who change behavior due to change of rules). Now the majority of women are seeking these previously alpha men (because even if they don't please him enough to secure his commitment, government will secure his resources for her). Only women who think they have no chance of attracting an alpha man or those with extremely high levels of impulse control are those who go after the provider men.

So the women of our society stop rewarding men who protect and provide and instead reward men who are not contributing to society, who are less stable, and who are more rebel like (anti-establishment). Men, of course, react by becoming those types of men to be rewarded. Social stability takes a nosedive and, well, welcome to the death-throes of western civilization.

For example, the common example of emotionless stoicism. The is clearly NOT a toxic gender expectation placed on women, that is one places on men.

So do I need to say ""Toxic gender norm and expectations of masculinity"" when I am referring specifically to the ones that are masculine, and then ""toxic gender norms and expectations of femininity"" if I'm talking about like being coquettish and coy and submissive?

If we are talking about the concept of gender norms broadly, then no need to be gendered, we can just say gender norms. But since most conversation about the topic quickly gets to which specific behavior or expectation is causing the damage, and very few of the norms apply to both genders, most of them are gendered, then we very quickly have to start talking about it in a gendered way.

I guess, you agree that there are gender expectations that are placed on masculinity that are bad and toxic and damaging....right?

I guess I did have someone tell me it’s called “internalized misogyny” once, that is ringing a bell. But so what? Call toxic masculinity “internalized misandry” then?

And I dunno, I’ve used the term “toxic masculinity” with other men many time to describe things like unnoticed stoicism that hurts men, not as a form of attacking men but as a genuine problem to be addressed. 

And I gotta say man, for my own sake, I don’t think I’ve ever felt attacked or bashed by the term
Toxic masculinity. When someone says “x behavior is toxic masculinity” I usually either go “you’re right by, it does suck and is harmful” or “eh, I don’t think that’s toxic, I think you’re wrong” or “I agree that’s toxic but don’t think that is really a masculine thing, I think that applies equally to both genders”. 

It’s really easy.  And either way, I don’t feel attacked, cause if I think it’s toxic then of course I agree the behavior should stop, especially if I’m doing it, and if I don’t think it’s toxic then whatever, that person and I disagree.

MRAs: Ah see! Feminism and progressivism and the last century of gender and sexual progress are refuted!

As if women and men did also have romantic woes under \*checks notes\* ah yes literally every single romantic or gender or societal norm that has ever existed since the start of written history.

We have texts in freaking Cuneiform of people griping about their love lives and that state of the dating scene. The Epic of Gilgamesh has a pretty big subplot about sexual jealously and the taking of other men (or god's) wives, and that's, ya know, just the first book ever written. People didn't complain about the nature of romance and coupling and social roles and the vagaries of affairs and concubines and whatnot in the 50s? or the 20s? Or the 1850s for that matter?

This lady having this gripe now is in no way any more a refutation of the current romantic status quo than every other person who has ever griped about romance and love throughout all of history was a refutation of those set ups.

People have always, and will always, have romantic troubles and dissatisfactions and angst and gripes no matter the social or romantic norms they exist under. It's just part of the human condition.

Think of your ideal perfect world in which dating and sexual norms work exactly as you think they should. A version of this lady and this complaint would exist for that as well, and you wouldn't consider it a refutation would you?

Female sexual choice (rotating TEMPORARY monogamy, or some kind of carousel) has become normalised. Dating apps have facilitated a trend which was already here. The major study by J D Unwin suggests that it has a corrosive effect on the stability and progress of society. It could take as little as three generations for collapse.

Women are the defaulters in the underlying rules of the mating game. This has been made possible by the service economy, where women can work. Previously, when nearly all work was physical, laborious and demanding, women knew that they NEEDED men, pretty much for survival, and certainly if they wanted to raise a family.

n6u0to1,1mgziaj,MensRights,World-Three,"It's not just high value... Its impulse and status. 


If you're a hot guy with options, there's basically a ""Limited time offer"" expectation with that. ""If you don't talk to him NOW, you'll miss this once in a lifetime deal."" It doesn't make sense at first, but the idea here is that when people are considered valuable, the opportunity to get them becomes precuous... Like you are sniping a bid at the last second. And just like that action, paying more than you typically would to win that item is common. So the men women are more invested in are just hot men who make women act on impulse.


Think of the opposite now. Men who try to get to know women naturally. Women break off from these men, put them in the friendzone, call them passive aggressive, use them, and don't value their time. Why? Because to them, these men are the generic brand. I'll buy it if I'm struggling and starving, they'll always be there, and as soon as I come into money, I'm buying name brand again.


The dropoff in value is also sustained with the cultural shift on men rushing to find a partner to bond with. Women are not shamed anymore for finding a younger man, but men are shamed for finding a younger woman. The stigmatized idea that men aren't allowed to do this forces men who care about their social morality and want an younger woman and children of their own, to choose sooner, and just like the women, choose poorly. Because if they don't choose soon enough, the bodies will pile higher. 


The absence of better is what makes that more of a problem... If more women are doing Onlyfans and chasing attention, climbing the economical ladder sexually, the standard of a good woman is lowered. Women themselves are destroying men's desire to perform in a race so large they'd never see a podium in their life. Dates cost this much, that's the bare minimum, protect us, defend us, etc, for goodness sake and nothing else. Good men are rightfully giving up, and that just leaves more poor choices on the table.


Morality was the backbone of this. A bird in your hand is worth more than two in a bush... But that's only if you're hunting... If you're attracting, you don't need to hold onto any birds until you're no longer attractive, the birds come to you. That's the mindset that is conveyed now. And while it's true, how valuable are the birds to you if you know you are just catching and releasing them like fish? They're just numbers now. The exact same thing women used to criticize men for doing, is what they're promoting... And the same thing we hate, we're promoting by supporting Onlyfans and things like it. 


What sucks is that only the people who are impulsive can stop it, but even if they did, someone will take their place. Everyone needs to stop all at once or to the impulsive it'll just feel like them letting someone else have what they could, even though they didn't really have it themselves. ",2,2025-08-04 00:45:48,False,Protestant work ethics and how it really works,13,2025-08-03 17:43:47,31,,,,,,[]

He's less likely to be railroaded into society's attempts to get him married off, and made into a productive, 'respectable' citizen.

Remove that foreskin, and he's more likely to stick it in crazy, and become a father. He can now be controlled by Church and State.

+ I would be seriously confused if he and Vanessa Kirby weren't having an affair given how she acts with him. The way she acts towards him is what most people use to defend the ""creeper"" allegations - [see the : ""I consent,"" ""I consent,"" ""I don't!"" meme] - but that should make him look bad as well. V. Kirby is pregnant with another man's child.


+ Who the fuck needs to touch other people to mitigate their own anxiety? i get anxious and I don't need to do this. 


+ He has done this *so many times* it's like Joe Biden at this point.


+ He keeps on appearing in satanic adverts. e.g one where he was being groped by multiple women's disembodied arms. 


+ Also not a nice person. Huge 'male feminist' vibes, he seems to be a communist as far as I can tell (everyone's entitled to their beliefs but he's militant about it. i.e see his tweets.... Bullying JK Rowling for instance.)


Also my thoughts but arguing the other way:


+ The man is from Chile and in his defence I can totally believe they're a bit more touchy there. This would line up with people I've met from Chile and the general impression created by SA culture (South American, lol)


+ It *is* plausible that this is a slander campaign by JK Rowling. The first people I saw pedalling the narrative were RW meme pages + influencers on twitter - notably the vocally anti-trans ones. Example: 'Kaguya's Top Gal' (@hayasaka_aryan) and 'pagliacci the hated' (@slatzism). It would actually make sense for the latter to be in contact with JK Rowling. That said, I followed and support these peoples' beliefs myself. I no longer have twitter.


If you believe he's innocent, stand for that, I/we won't hold it against you. I would like for him to change his ways.

Dark times man. We just talk about how easy it's to ruin a man's life by making accusations without any real evidence... but here we are, completely justifying it because the man is ""feminist."" Istead of arguing how flawed his beliefs we are seeking to get back at him in a karmic gotcha. Like the very people we are fighting against. True horror story.


I'm convinced this accusations are actually coming from male demograhic. It's pretty certain by the looks of it. I would like to congratulate men making men to defend themselves much harder today. Serving the feminist cause.

You're trying so hard to sound deep, but your argument is held together with wet tissue paper, bubblegum, and wishful thinking. 

Lets get a few things straight:  
1.) I didn't say all touchy behavior is predatory. I said Pascals specific pattern of behavior - conveniently aimed at attractive women, under the banner of anxiety - raises eyebrows.   
2.) Saying ""I've seen friends touch each other inappropriately"" like that makes it normal just proves my point. If you're calling it inappropriate, it's not the flex you think it is. Get it? YOU called it inappropriate.   
3.) Calling me a creep for pointing out public footage of someone repeatedly doing the same thing isn't a defense, it's a tantrum. You didn't rebut what I said. You just tried to flip it. Which is lame as fuck.   
4.) Calling men creepy is creepy"" is the dumbest take I've seen on Reddit lately. It isn't logic - it's a toddler screaming ""NO YOU'RE THE PROBLEM"" because they dont want to hear the truth.

Grow up. You can like Pascal and still acknowledge that he's not untouchable. This fanboy meltdown you're having doesn't make him innocent. It just makes you look obsessed.

n6tluwr,1mfvybc,MensRights,Angryasfk,"Why do they do this?

Well some don’t even bother with the pretence.  

But in general it’s a combination of a number of factors:

One is to appeal to women like you.  The idea is to draw you in “oh we don’t hate men, we *love* men”.  And it keeps women listening to them whilst they work them over.

And in the end these women *still* think they don’t hate men, even as they’ve internalised ideology based on hating men.

And then there’s the other factor: most women who regard themselves as feminists are hetero.  Yes it’s disproportionately lesbian (or bi) especially amongst the leadership or most vocal.  But the bulk of feminists are either seeking relationships with men, or at least sexually desire them.  So some will deny they hate men because they “love their bf or partner”.   Or say they aren’t anti-male because they desire them, and think that means they don’t hate them.  

But ultimately it’s because feminists want to believe they’re on the side of the angels.  And are “only seeking equality”.  So they can never admit that they’re causing harm to men; or that men ever have it worse in any sphere at all (the last one is the most glaring feature of feminism).  And they can certainly never, ever admit that they’re driven by the hatred of men - and that they are exactly what they claim to be against.",2,2025-08-03 22:27:52,False,Tired of Feminists Pretending to Care About Men,292,2025-08-02 10:18:11,48,,,,,,[]

n6w4ike,1mfvybc,MensRights,Bitter-Section-946,"Gonna be honest here. The question, although innocent enough has just enough ignorance to be infuriating. That said, it could be genuine, so I'll do my best to answer in swaths - if pressed, I can provide examples:

1. The systems and processes in place. 
Although the language used may be equal in many cases, practices and execution aren't.  For example, law enforcement practices an active definition of assault being (paraphrased), if you're larger, or stronger,  then you can't be assaulted.  This is giving women carte blanche to enact the legal definition of assault, without fear of consequence. Rape is another example except this goes to definition - in order to rape, one must be penetrated. There are countless examples of female nurses or teachers forcing themselves on boys and men with little to no consequence.

2. Men are held to a different standard.
A) The consequence for infractions are not equal for the same act. Men are treated far more harshly than women for rule violations. Search r/mensrights for examples, look at crime stats

B) Men are expected to sacrifice without question or thought. For example, Men can be conscripted - I don't hear feminism fighting for equality here.

C) Family law - arguably a subset of the first bullet, blindly grants women custody, decision making, and financial ""balance"". Men are pushing a rope - despite what the stats say about the ability of single fathers to raise responsible, productive little humans.

D) Abortion - no argument, women carry a child for 9 months. On the same hand, it can't be argued that you can't get pregnant without a man. Why are women fighting for the right to abort the child on their sole discretion? The guy has no say, and is held financially responsible regardless of what their perspective is. 

3. Culture and apathy / ignorance towards male struggle.
The world is unilaterally focused on women and making a better world for them. I think it's safe to say, we've accomplished that. There's been no consideration for impact to Men, or creating a level playing field.  The focus is solely on female advancement - this comes often at the expense of males. For example, any hint of misogyny is vilified immediately and widely. What's crept in place are subtle and often not so subtle statements of mysandry. These are embraced and accepted as universal truths. The best example I can think of is the internet meme bear vs strange man in the wilderness. It's easy for women to say they would prefer to meet the bear, and accept this as universal truth. Did all of these women honestly think this through? How is this even a question? How many women answering that survey have actually come across a bear? 

4. Socialization 
With women now earning more (entry level positions women are now on average $1k higher than men), better educated (more women are graduating higher education than men), the traditional role of ""provider"" for men needs to be redefined. This has direct impact on points 2 and 3 above. 

5. Mental health

1. Set the standard. Apply it to both genders.

2. Understand how this standard applies to both men and women. We fool ourselves into believing men and women are equal. There are physical strengths and limitations to both, eg., men are stronger in general, women are more flexible. There is also differences in how we are socialized and interact. Go to any high-school in the world to watch true human nature. When guys fight, people end up with bruises,  when girls fight, people end up with eating disorders. Current laws focus only on bruises and how men present. 

3. Hold people similarly accountable. Apply similar corrective measures for outcomes for genders. Similar crimes should yield similar corrections. Gender shouldn't play a role.

As for support from the opposite sex, that's more difficult.  Men's issues are in a vacuum - largely by design. Men are taught from day one:
1. No one cares about you, 
2. The world only cares about what you produce.

n6pooiy,1mftduj,MensRights,MaleEducation1,"Emotional intelligence is not something that is really easy to measure, so I definitely am skeptical if it is really reliable.

Regarding equal capacity, while there are cognitive differences between males and females on average (it is well established), these differences are generally quite small (0.1-0.3d) for most, so there is plenty of overlap between the sex. The individual variation being greater than the mean differences, so stereotyping people like this is not a good idea. 

Though, from an evolutionary point of view, it has been determined the sexes do differ in certain cognitive abilities.

[Women seem to have an advantage in social cognition ](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/male-female/201910/women-s-advantages-in-social-cognition)and on the flip side, [men tend to have an advantage in spatial cognition and mechanical reasoning](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/male-female/201910/mens-advantages-in-spatial-cognition-mechanical-reasoning). 

A meta-analysis by [Joseph & Newman (2010)](https://sci-hub.se/10.1037/a0017286) did show a decent **female advantage** in Emotional Intelligence (**EQ**) by around **0.47 standard deviations**.

**Social cognition** is also associated with EQ. [Thompson & Voyer (2014)](https://sci-hub.se/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2013.875889) showed a small advantage in favor of **females** for **identifying emotions (0.19d)** and [Hall (1978) ](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.85.4.845)showed a moderate **female advantage** in the ability to **decode non-verbal cues (0.40d)**.

Males advantage in **spatial abilities** generally average out to about **half a standard deviation (\~0.5d)** and are as big about **one standard deviation** (\~**1.0d**) for certain abilities.([Linn and Petersen (1985)](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.2307/1130467); [Voyer, Voyer & Bryden (1995)](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.117.2.250); [Silverman, Choi & Peters (2007)](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-006-9168-6); [Archer (2019)](https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/brv.12507)).

In **Mechanical Reasoning**, a **male advantage** of \~0.98d (\*\*about a Standard Deviation) was reported in a meta-analysis by [Archer (2019)](https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/brv.12507).

I have never seen a population of people flip their shit quicker over the most inanely tiny of slights than men.

Women maybe tend to be more emotive? I guess. But go to a video game sub reddit when a new entry in the franchise makes the female character marginally less fuckable and see just how emotionally disciplined men are. Hint: Not very.

There weren't very many women out there mad when they made the green M&M less sexy, but you have the primetime anchor of the new network with the highest % of male viewers decide it was worthwhile to go gripe about it. Same network, same time slot, but different anchor a few years later goes off about how drinking from straws makes you look feminine and straws are part of the gay agenda. Remember when Shapiro went on a big rand about how Minaj described a pussy as being actually TOO wet in WAP, and that just really got under ben's skin and he felt the need to stand up in the (digital) town square and grab the mic and make a speech about it, about how that pussy is just TOO damn wet, and it's not realistic?

This is not the behavior of people with emotional control.

Im not big on the spectrum and will only talk with people i find truelly interesting.
I figured out how to build my life. I can get a job, bought a house, spend as little as possible and save/invest as much as possible. Should be able to quit working in a couple of years and live a quite and peacefull live.
I know this is not for all my autistic friends, but i found what works for me. Focus on things, things that make me happy and i excell in. 
I do practice my social muscles, but its difficult (and i dont take very much joy in it). Mainly to be able to have small convos here and there.
Groups of up to 5 people is ok, anything above that i go quite.

Going on a full carnivore diet is helping my mind tremendously. Im not saying my autism or the bullying and problems from my youth are going away, but its improving.

People around me dont get it. Women always look at me, its just useless to talk with them. So friends have opinions on that (where i already know there is no use to even talk to a woman, it always ends the same way). Even my best friend (who i know for around 20y) can't understand this. He and his family do accept me though, so thats a nice thing.
Family is out the door, as described by you (to a tee unfortunately).

I just mind my own business, hoping i can exit this western world and live in a quite place with a couple of dogs, diving gear and a boat to spend the rest of my life. Perhaps i can even find another autistic dude to live an awesome life with.

n6lv1eq,1mfyyik,MensRights,mrmensplights,"Just your daily reminder that Reeves is controlled opposition. He's the ""menslib"" of discourse on men. He's one answer the democrats have for losing the male vote. His job is capture the energy male advocacy has built up and dispel it safely in a way that will win votes for Democrats and put male advocacy under the umbrella of prevailing gender paradigms. 

There is some value in Reeves technocratic and incremental approach to boys issues. Just because his work is aligned with Democratic electoral interests does not mean boys and men gain nothing from it. However, the scope and depth of proposed reforms are modest and carefully contained within the feminist-informed gender orthodoxy dominant on the political left. As a result, Reeves completely avoids contentious but critical issues such as family court and legal biases against fathers, false accusations and due process rights, and any critique of prevailing cultural narratives that pathologize masculinity. He steers clear of analyzing how media, education systems, and corporate HR policies treat male traits as problematic, and he does not address male disenfranchisement in gender policy. He doesn't look at the male-only draft registration or selective service. While some progress may be achieved under his framework, it remains circumscribed by ideological boundaries that preclude systemic structural change.

Still, he does touch on education, labor market, mental health and parental alienation. Again, his policy recommendations are constrained by his ideology but one could argue moving the needle at all is a good thing. Maybe in the future instead of continuously apologizing and assuring viewers that he thinks women are swell and feminism is great, they can just put a banner permanently at the bottom of the video.

She also document exactly how feminists ( who she used to align herself with) are actively making this problem much worse and are doing so on purpose.

There is a foundational error in the feminist narrative about men, and it results in laws and cultural norms that are harmful to men and drive men to take defensive action (which is often a withdrawal from society and/or relationships with women).  This foundational error leads people to think that the real risks men face don't exist, that the suffering imposed on men doesn't hurt, and that their (warranted) defensive reactions come from a place of selfishness or hatred.  But telling them ""you have the wrong feelings, you should be feeling this instead, and you should be doing this-and-that despite the high threat of injury and paltry rewards"" is not going to convince them of anything but your own delusion.

n6tp2mk,1mfyyik,MensRights,Angryasfk,"Feminism always relies on half truths and misconceptions.  

As far as I can see, this “bank account” stuff comes from the 1974 equal credit act.  This was a law that applied to “credit cards” and bank loans (and in the pre-deregulation era when it was much harder to borrow money).  It is NOT about back accounts, which are a separate thing.

Credit cards emerged in a time when married women would typically quit work to raise children.  So naturally enough, banks wanted her husband to be guarantor of these loans, so that if she quit the job she had when she applied for the card, he would be legally required to pay her debt.  Remember, back then you normally did not get a credit card when you opened a bank account.  You had to apply for one separately.  

It’s understandable why a bank would ask for this, although I can see why a professional woman would see it as demeaning.  

Roll the clock forward to the mid-‘70’s, married women were staying in the workforce in ever increasing numbers (partly because there were far more women with degrees, but also because the rise in real wages has begun to stall and more and more people opted for dual incomes to meet their expectations).  And so pressure built to end this unequal treatment.  And through the bill went.

n6nra7w,1mfyyik,MensRights,initialgold,"Hm I see what you mean. Maybe I can explain why this isn't a ""controlled opposition""/conspiracy thing. Hopefully this doesn't bore you.

In public policy analysis there's this idea called ""[multiple streams framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_streams_framework)."" (i am in a Master of Public Policy & Administration program so I recently learned about this). This idea was proposed and fleshed out over 20 years ago.

It basically says that there are 3 separate but related streams when it comes to the policy making process. the Problem Stream, the Policy Stream, and the Politics Stream.

When politicians' attention becomes focused on a ""new"" problem (new in the sense that they weren't paying attention before, not new in that the problem itself is new), they look around and see what ideas there are to solve this problem. Because most politicians even with their staff are not experts on every possible area.

What Richard Reeves was doing, even before the 2024 election, was working on developing policies to address issues of boys and men. He started doing this at Brookings, wrote his book, etc. This was an example of the Policy Stream. It was happening the past couple years, even when Dem politicians weren't paying attention.

Reeves and others also tried to affect the Problem stream, which is basically framing the problem in a way that tries to draw political attention to it to then solve. Because the world is complicated, there's always a bunch of problems vying for attention at any given time.

So what you are seeing now, i.e. since trump won, is that the Problem Stream, Policy Stream, and Politics Stream are starting to converge (for Democrats). Democratic politicians are recognizing this is a problem (Problem Stream), they are then looking around places they are familiar with (ie Brookings and other think tanks) for who was already talking about this and who has ideas on how to fix it (ie people like Reeves, this is the Policy Stream). And then they are starting to act on it (this is the Politics Stream).

All this is to say, it isn't some conspiracy that Reeves ""shows up"" with answers. That isn't ""controlled opposition."" He was already in the space, already throwing out solutions. The only thing that's new is now Dem leaders are looking around for ideas on how to solve this problem that has made its way to the top (or at least on) their agendas because they got destroyed by Trump in an election. Reeves happens to fit into a mold of the type of person Democrats normally look to for policy ideas.

This is a fundamental process that happens in the vast majority of policy change when attention is drawn to a new problem. I could reiterate this whole breakdown for a totally separate policy space like housing or education or whatever. There's constantly scholars or bloggers or podcasters in all these fields working on and refining ideas, and politician's attention only occasionally turns to their field. when it does, those people's ideas are suddenly in vogue and popular, even if before no one knew their names. And when attention shifts away, they'll still be there doing the same thing. The difference will be that politicians just aren't paying attention.",2,2025-08-03 00:40:59,True,How Liberals Fail Young Men And What We Get Wrong About The Manosphere [This is Gavin Newsom w/ Richard Reeves],34,2025-08-02 12:24:57,100,,,,,,[]

n6p1sny,1mfyyik,MensRights,jessi387,"I thought I replied to this but I acicnetally posted in under a different thread. So I’m responding quite late but it’s because I thought you already saw it 

As I mentioned before, Warren Farrell, and Ch Sommers were in what you referred to as the problem stream and policy stream LOOOONG before Reeves was…. Sommers wrote her book back in 2000. I suggest you give it a read. She suggests much more useful solutions in the short term for this problem. All have been ignored.

She also document exactly how feminists ( who she used to align herself with) are actively making this problem much worse and are doing so on purpose.

So when you say things suggesting I’m some crazy conspiracy theorist, you might want to look at what people who were actually involved in the women’s movement and left, to talk about this, over 20 years ago have to say. But you haven’t read her book.

Warren Farrell has also been talking about this since the 90’s.

So when I say Richard Reeves shows up, I mean his involvement is fairly recent.

My question to you, why is it that neither of the aforementioned people were consulted post election, even though their pedigrees are far more extensive ?

Both are also Democrats btw. Sommers began, speaking on conservative platforms because they were the only ones who gave her the time of day with this issue.

n6fktm6,1mfa9o2,MensRights,_WutzInAName_,"It would be better to shut down gender-specific apps instead of creating more of them.

There's been more and more talk online about class action lawsuits against the women-only Tea App. If you believe you've been wronged, legal action is possible even if you don't know whether you've been posted. Read the following guidance from ChatGPT and contact a law firm to discuss if you're interested:

Yes—a man can bring a lawsuit even if he doesn’t yet know whether he’s been posted, and in fact, the very fact that men are categorically excluded from access is itself a legally actionable harm.

Here’s why.

⸻

1. **Exclusion Alone Creates Standing**

Even if a man hasn’t confirmed whether he was “doxxed,” the denial of access based on sex—while allowing women to use the app freely—is itself:

• Gender discrimination under state civil rights laws (like California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act, which applies to all businesses, including apps).

• A deprivation of equal access to a commercial service, which courts increasingly recognize as a harm in itself (especially when paired with reputational risk).

That means any man could sue on the grounds that he is denied the ability to monitor, defend, or correct information posted about him.

⸻

**2. The Catch-22 Actually Strengthens the Case**

The app’s design—allowing women to post names, photos, and accusations while denying men the ability to know, verify, or respond—could be argued as:

• A due process and fairness violation (in civil contexts, not constitutional, but as a principle in consumer protection claims).

• An inherently discriminatory business practice because it creates a closed ecosystem where only one gender can participate, while the other is targeted.

This also bolsters arguments for injunctive relief (a court order to shut down or modify the app) even before damages are proven.

⸻

**3. How a Plaintiff Could Proceed**

There are two main routes:

*A. Individual Lawsuit (Civil Rights/Consumer Protection)*

A single man (even one who doesn’t know if he’s posted) could sue on the basis of:

1. Being categorically denied access due to gender.
2. The foreseeable risk of reputational harm because he cannot monitor or defend himself.
3. Apple’s participation (hosting and profiting despite the discrimination).

*B. Class Action*

Because every man is excluded by design, attorneys could file a class action on behalf of all men denied access, seeking:

• Statutory damages (many civil rights statutes provide automatic damages per violation),

• An injunction forcing Apple to remove or alter the app,

• Potential punitive damages if the conduct is deemed reckless or exploitative.

⸻

**4. How Apple Becomes Liable**

Normally, Apple could hide behind Section 230. But:

• Section 230 does not cover civil rights claims, unfair business practices, or Apple’s own decision to distribute a discriminatory app.

• Apple profits directly (via App Store fees) and has developer policies explicitly banning apps that promote harassment or discrimination, so knowingly hosting this app could be framed as negligence or willful misconduct.

⸻

**5. So, Can “Any Man” Sue?**

Yes. Even without proof that he’s posted:

• The denial of equal access is enough to establish standing.

• The risk of reputational harm (since he cannot even check or appeal posts about him) strengthens the case for injunctive relief.

Here you say we can't argue against a female only app and then in favor of a male only app. Think of it more as saying 'Oh, it IS okay to have an app for protection. Let's do that for everyone.'

n6g961m,1mfa9o2,MensRights,-1984-Equals-1776-,"Are you planning on charging for it or just asking for donations? I don't know anything about app creation, but if you make it work with Android, or both OS', couldn't you just rent a website and put them both up as unofficial apps, let them be downloaded for free, and then accept donations? 


Just bypass both stores, since they aren't going to host anything that benefits men or counters things like the tea app. And doing it yourself as a free ""non profit"" app, but accepting donations, would be a great middle finger to them.


Get it done and compatible, then get a web domain with plenty of bandwidth for downloads (I assume the file size is small). Then supply the link to this and all other men's subreddits and spaces you know of, and everyone can share share share. And men would share this, if it is basically the tea app but for men only, which would be difficult to enforce, it would become a big thing very quickly. And as for enforcing men only, I guess the rule should be that only women can be posted on it, or something along those lines?


Like I said I know nothing about app creation, so I could be way off base, and I'm sure it's a lot more complicated than ""just make it compatible bro"" lol. I'm just trying to be helpful, you are doing a good thing, something like this NEEDS to happen. And you know, there are always options like gofundme and kickstarter to help pay for web services, just be careful not to explicitly state what the app does, but maybe more like ""an app for men's wellbeing"" which is not a lie, then link to the kickstarter/gofundme from men's forums, where you state the actual purpose of the app. 😉


Even me for example, I'm extremely broke right now, going through some transitions, but even though I'm having trouble just staying afloat, I would still scrape together as much as I could for a donation. Because of how necessary this is, I think you'll find that men around the world are more than willing to help, and you might even get more through donations than you would by charging for it.


Anyways I hope the ideas were helpful, have a good one.",17,2025-08-01 18:00:02,False,My all male iOS app has been rejected by Apple,1149,2025-08-01 15:29:40,131,,,,,,[]

It’s terrible that apps like Tea have discriminated against and victimized a lot of innocent men, but I don’t think the right way to respond to that is by coming up with something that discriminates against and victimizes innocent women. 

The right way to respond, imho, is to bring the people responsible for discriminating against and victimizing innocent men on Tea to justice.
