n3fle9c,1m18vhe,Fauxmoi,Global-Letter-4984,"Slightly off topic: Lauren is very intelligent and capable, but she has always used that massive intelligence to rationalize hateful right wing ideology and position herself as the rare woman who is above all of the typical misogynistic criticisms that the patriarchy throws at women, being “not like the other girls” in essence.

However, now that she is a single mom, a woman in her thirties (no longer “young”!), not a virgin or a wife, etc. she is no longer able to position herself as the typical conservative dream girl, and she’s choosing to brand herself as “not like the other girls” in a new way—by attempting to be more nuanced (victim-blaming herself?!), more complex (seeing both sides?!), more “empathetic” (to Andrew Tate?!!), and still not calling herself a feminist.

I went ahead and gave Lauren’s chapters a read, and I can tell she is still very much hungry for the approval of who she was indoctrinated her whole life to think is valuable: powerful, “intellectual”, white men. She thinks she can do that by being more centrist now.

Her new belief system doesn’t seem to be indicative of a true values shift. Rather, it is her clinging to the last vestiges of her conservative indoctrination (namely internalized misogyny and the centering of white maleness) while attempting to reconcile them with her own horrible experience with how right wing ideology treats women, ALL women no matter how “perfect” they might have seemed at the time.",24,2025-07-16 05:09:39,Andrew Tate,Retired conservative commentator Lauren Southern shares she was brutally raped by Andrew Tate in 2018

mzig3ur,1ljabgi,TrueUnpopularOpinion,AdIll814,Here’s the truth in its entirety. I’m an avid viewer of Andrew Tate’s content. I’ve seen the good and the bad. I’m a part of the Real World. He’s a rank asshole online and outright offends people. It’s very difficult to talk shit about someone like Andrew Tate because hate him or love him he’s winning in life. Someone bragging about their riches has always pissed people off. He’s provocative and people obviously hate that. A lot of his opinions on women don’t help. Some of his lives are very cringe BUT if you’re being reasonable the whole human trafficker and rape thing is bogus. I’ve reviewed the cases because I wanted to make sure the man that I’m watching is in fact not a monster. Come to find out not only did he not do those things but there’s clear evidence of corruption regarding his case. He’s beat everything despite that which some of your favorite celebrities who have more resources couldn’t do. A DIICOT officer even admitted to him that he pissed off some very important people and that’s why some of this happened. It’s understandable to not like the guy but it’s honestly interesting to see the things people will let fly if they don’t like someone. He has valuable information and if you were smart you’d take the gems and just leave. Fuck his opinions. He’s also right wing so a lot of the hate he gets is politically charged and we already know how liberals act (just saying) and for as much as they tried to ruin him it just bears no fruit. The only thing left to do is just call him names and move on. Even I get sick of the dude sometimes but such is life.,-1,2025-06-24 06:48:42,Andrew Tate,There's nothing wrong with liking Andrew Tate

I remember several high school lectures about WW2 and Hitler’s rise to power and mentally responding with “Well someone had to save the economy.” Or other bullshit like that. 

I don’t know what saved me from going down that path. It could’ve been when my mom came out of the closet to me. It could’ve been my friend who declined going on a date, but said she still wanted to be friends, when I was truly desperate for real fucking friends.

Another kid said that these were just accusations and he hadn’t been convicted. A _third_ kid said “And even if he’s convicted, that doesn’t mean anything. President Trump got convicted, and that was just some greedy woman making up lies.”

For the ones hearing MAGA bullshit at home, this is central to the issue. If Trump did it, then it must work—never mind the actual results they see. In the grand tradition of MLM’s, it just means they aren’t trying hard enough. I’ve also heard them complain the girls they try this stupidity on aren’t “high quality,” so they didn’t want them anyway. 

I can’t emphasize enough how disturbing the impact of the manosphere has been on a number of teenagers in my primarily conservative area.

An online course founded by far-right influencer Andrew Tate was breached by hackers, revealing the email addresses of roughly 325,000 users.

The self-described online university, known as The Real World, offers users “advanced training and mentoring” for around $50 per month. Formerly known as Hustler’s University, the platform focuses on topics such as health and fitness, financial investment, and e-commerce businesses.

“Money making is a skill,” the website states. “We will teach you how to master it.”

On Thursday, the hackers made their actions known by flooding the course’s primary chatroom with emojis they uploaded while Tate was streaming an episode of his show “Emergency Meeting” on Rumble.

  
The emojis included a transgender flag, a feminist fist, an AI-generated image of Tate draped in a rainbow flag, another where his buttocks are enlarged, and the cat character used in the “boykisser” meme.",2276,2024-11-22 05:05:02,Andrew Tate,"Hackers breach Andrew Tate's online university, leak data on 800,000 users"

Current arrest record on Tate

EXCLUSIVE | Andrew and Tristan Tate, together with a former policewoman, detained for 24 hours in the case of human trafficking opened in the name of the two brothers. DIICOT + VIDEO clarifications from the searches and the exit from actual hearings

On Thursday, DIICOT prosecutors went to the house of a former policewoman from Bucharest, who is said to be part of the group specialized in human trafficking of brothers Tristan and Andrew Tate. The two Britons are suspected of exploiting several young women through a video chat studio set up near their villa in Pipera.

UPDATE 3 – DIICOT statement regarding this case:

""In the case, it was noted that, at the beginning of 2021, 4 suspects (two British citizens and two Romanian citizens) constituted a criminal group organized in order to commit the crime on the territory of Romania, but also of other countries, such as the USA and Great Britain of human trafficking.

The injured persons were recruited by British citizens by misrepresenting their intention to enter into a marriage/cohabitation relationship and the existence of real feelings of love (the «loverboy» method).

They were later transported and housed in buildings in Ilfov county where, by exercising acts of physical violence and mental coercion (through intimidation, constant surveillance, control and invoking alleged debts), they were sexually exploited by group members by forcing them to perform demonstrations pornographic for the purpose of producing and disseminating material of such a nature through social media platforms and by submitting to the execution of a work, in a forced manner, in order to obtain important financial benefits consisting of the sums of money obtained as a result of accessing the materials by users.

To date, 6 injured persons have been identified who were sexually exploited by the organized criminal group.

With regard to the crime of rape, it was noted that, in March 2022, an injured person was forced, on two different occasions, by a suspect through the exercise of physical violence and psychological pressure to have sexual relations.

At the headquarters of the Directorate for the Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism - Central Structure, 4 people who are reasonably suspected of being involved in criminal activity were taken for questioning.

Following the hearings, the prosecutors of the Directorate for the Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism - Central Structure ordered the measure of detention for a period of 24 hours against the 4 persons"".

UPDATE 2 – The Tate brothers and the former policewoman, detained for 24 hours

According to GANDUL sources, arrest warrants were issued for 24 hours for the Tate brothers, but also for the former policewoman involved in this case.

UPDATE – The searches in the case of the Tate brothers, accused of human trafficking along with a former policewoman, have ended. All three perpetrators were taken to DIICOT headquarters for questioning

The searches in the case of the British brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate, accused of human trafficking along with a former policewoman, ended on Thursday evening. All three perpetrators were taken to DIICOT headquarters for questioning .

Original news:

In this case, investigators first descended on the Pipera address of brothers Tristan and Andrew Tate on April 11, when a complaint was received at the US Embassy regarding the fact that a woman with American citizenship was being forcibly held at their residence.

Initially, the investigation was carried out by the Ilfov police, who immediately descended on their home, in a case opened under the coordination of the prosecutors of the Prosecutor's Office attached to the Buftea Court, for deprivation of liberty and rape.

On this occasion, the Romanian authorities learned that the British had a video chat studio , which operated in a building located approximately 500 meters from their villa. Several young women were found there, including the woman with American citizenship, but also a young woman from the Republic of Moldova.

The two are said to have said at the time that they were being held against their will after being rounded up using a method commonly used by human traffickers known generically as ""loverboy"".

In this regard, the young woman from America would have stated that she met Tristan Tate through a social network, and he would have seduced her and convinced her to buy a plane ticket and come to Romania.

She allegedly abandoned her boyfriend and came to live with the British millionaire, but found herself threatened and forced to work as a video chat model. Frightened, she contacted her ex-boyfriend, who, in turn, notified the US Embassy in Bucharest.

After realizing that the evidence described crimes similar to organized crime, Buftea prosecutors declined jurisdiction to the Directorate for the Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism.

The investigators waited for the Tate brothers to return to Romania For nine months, anti-mafia prosecutors put together all the evidence taken from the Tate brothers' villa and from the video chat studio, in order to be able to prove that the accusations made during the hearings by their alleged victims are real.

Sources close to the investigation stated, for Gândul , that shortly after the completion of the computer expertise, the authorities waited for the right moment to catch the Tate brothers, who were always out of the country.

After seeing, including on social networks, that they were together in Romania, the DIICOT prosecutors mobilized the special troops of the Gendarmerie and descended, by force, on their villa in Pipera, but also on other addresses.

The quoted sources stated that one of the searches targeted a former policewoman from the 7th Section, who left the Capital Police and started videochatting.

She is accused that, in addition to working side by side with the rest of the models, she would have taken care to put pressure on the girls held in the studio against their will. The woman was picked up and taken to DIICOT headquarters for questioning.",164,2022-12-29 16:16:22,Andrew Tate,Luxury villa of influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan raided by Romanian police

Edit: So, some of you guys have decided to try and fight with me. But I don't really want to waste my time, so please read the following text:

You really think these are one of the times they arrested an innocent person? Look man, completely unbiased opinion, but if someone is arrested TWICE under the same charges, it's likely because of said charges. I'm not about to go waste time investigating this guy because someone on the internet wants to defend him due to their own opinion. Just because there's some slight almost none existence chance he's guilty, does not mean I want to take that chance. Look, you want to say the authorities are corrupted? Okay then, tell me why a corrupted organisation would want to arrest Andrew Tate? It's not like he's discovered some completely new thing. I'm sure you guys who joined his discord server are smart enough to know by now that his discord server is just basic financial advice you can get online. So, do tell, why would they suddenly arrest Andrew Tate, if he wasn't doing something secretive or completely illegal? I highly doubt he's sneaking out at night to visit children hospitals. There's no basis for that argument. I'm not the one who needs to do research, if you're the one who wants to disprove the authorities, *you have to do it*. How about, since you're such a big fan of Andrew Tate, go and bust him out of jail instead? Why come here and tell me to help the authorities, when they're just doing their job and you're the one who wants to make some sort of change?

We are not in ""tha matrix"", please wake up. I'm sure you'll find that you actually have supportive family members to reach out to and get back on track if you have fallen too far down the rabbit hole. It's not too late to stop believing in propoganda. For those who really don't seem to understand, all I can say is that you try looking at Andrew Tate as a whole again.

j7fz27g,10v3d9h,agedlikemilk,RawAiArt,"I recently got in argument with one Andrew Tate fan teenage boy, he said Tate are innocent and there is no proof. I had to spend some time for this teenage boy to explaine basic stuff, thats because there isnt video of Tate doing something wrong in internet does not means there are not evidences. I really had to go in details to explaine him so basic things like, police not always will release evidences to public and evidences can containe from other many things, not just video, there can be like wrong paperworks, money transations, fingerprints, signatures, forbiden deals and so on. If Tate would have been innocent, then how police could get a warrant for seize his cars and arrest him? I think that these teenage boys dont know that to achieve to get a warrant, you actually first need the proof because otherwise nobody will issue the warrant and police wont be able to seize property or make a arrest. 

Ofcourse without judgment I also explaine to this teenager that there are alot of bad people out there like Andrew Tate who are very well skilled in talking, making them sound like music to you ears and feel good about yourself till the time you realise you are traped in bad situation and so on. These things dont go towards to womens only, for example he doing this same thing towards to teenage boy by using his own set up staged podcasts and even pay money to get on other podcasters to be on they show while speaking things what lonely, depressed men, boys would like to hear to feel praised and happy about themselfs but that is all part of what he do, manupilate people.

Its really sad to see that teenagers easly fall for people who simply gave them motivational speech and mental support by someone in internet. I know I am not in place to judge anyone but this is the big sign for parents to show they love and support more to they teenagers. I am not pefect myself I was a criminal since I was 15 years old and have already been in jail, now I am 30 and oh boy I do regret now that I skipped school and didnt become something what I dreamed about.

A new girl started at work recently and apparently her boyfriend is super into Andrew Tate. She's 19, he's in his mid 20s. He abuses the shit out of her and she can't even see it.

 ""Well, Andrew Tate did nothing wrong, he's just teaching young men how to not be f*ggots!"" And ""My parents didn't raise me to be a bitch woman that hits a man. Hitting a woman is just the natural order of things"" are both horrifying statements she's casually dropped.

One time he called her in the middle of dinner service screaming at her because he couldn't find his credit card. She ran out, and I could still hear her crying and insisting she didn't take it. Eventually he found it in his fucking pocket and just hung up.

Another time, our pregnant coworker was crossing the street to her car and this guy came peeling around the corner to pick up the new girl. Pregnant coworker jogged out of the way since he wouldn't slow down, and he swerved toward her still. She could feel the wind of the car so strongly. He glared at her and flipped her off after almost hitting her. The next day, the new girl came in apologizing profusely after pregnant coworker's boyfriend yelled at her for it (not knowing she's in an abusive situation) and she excused her shitbag boyfriend by saying ""he was just having a bad day"".

She's also been impregnated 5 times by the guy and ""lost"" every one of them. He won't let her take birth control and hates condoms.

DIICOT + VIDEO clarifications from the searches and the exit from actual hearings
 
 
On Thursday, DIICOT prosecutors went to the house of a former policewoman from Bucharest, who is said to be part of the group specialized in human trafficking of brothers Tristan and Andrew Tate. The two Britons are suspected of exploiting several young women through a video chat studio set up near their villa in Pipera.

UPDATE 3 – DIICOT statement regarding this case:

""In the case, it was noted that, at the beginning of 2021, 4 suspects (two British citizens and two Romanian citizens) constituted a criminal group organized in order to commit the crime on the territory of Romania, but also of other countries, such as the USA and Great Britain of human trafficking.

The injured persons were recruited by British citizens by misrepresenting their intention to enter into a marriage/cohabitation relationship and the existence of real feelings of love (the «loverboy» method).

They were later transported and housed in buildings in Ilfov county where, by exercising acts of physical violence and mental coercion (through intimidation, constant surveillance, control and invoking alleged debts), they were sexually exploited by group members by forcing them to perform demonstrations pornographic for the purpose of producing and disseminating material of such a nature through social media platforms and by submitting to the execution of a work, in a forced manner, in order to obtain important financial benefits consisting of the sums of money obtained as a result of accessing the materials by users.

To date, 6 injured persons have been identified who were sexually exploited by the organized criminal group.

With regard to the crime of rape, it was noted that, in March 2022, an injured person was forced, on two different occasions, by a suspect through the exercise of physical violence and psychological pressure to have sexual relations.

At the headquarters of the Directorate for the Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism - Central Structure, 4 people who are reasonably suspected of being involved in criminal activity were taken for questioning.

Following the hearings, the prosecutors of the Directorate for the Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism - Central Structure ordered the measure of detention for a period of 24 hours against the 4 persons"".

UPDATE 2 – The Tate brothers and the former policewoman, detained for 24 hours

According to GANDUL sources, arrest warrants were issued for 24 hours for the Tate brothers, but also for the former policewoman involved in this case.

UPDATE – The searches in the case of the Tate brothers, accused of human trafficking along with a former policewoman, have ended. All three perpetrators were taken to DIICOT headquarters for questioning

The searches in the case of the British brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate, accused of human trafficking along with a former policewoman, ended on Thursday evening. All three perpetrators were taken to DIICOT headquarters for questioning .



Original news:

In this case, investigators first descended on the Pipera address of brothers Tristan and Andrew Tate on April 11, when a complaint was received at the US Embassy regarding the fact that a woman with American citizenship was being forcibly held at their residence.

Initially, the investigation was carried out by the Ilfov police, who immediately descended on their home, in a case opened under the coordination of the prosecutors of the Prosecutor's Office attached to the Buftea Court, for deprivation of liberty and rape.

On this occasion, the Romanian authorities learned that the British had a video chat studio , which operated in a building located approximately 500 meters from their villa. Several young women were found there, including the woman with American citizenship, but also a young woman from the Republic of Moldova.

The two are said to have said at the time that they were being held against their will after being rounded up using a method commonly used by human traffickers known generically as ""loverboy"".

In this regard, the young woman from America would have stated that she met Tristan Tate through a social network, and he would have seduced her and convinced her to buy a plane ticket and come to Romania.

She allegedly abandoned her boyfriend and came to live with the British millionaire, but found herself threatened and forced to work as a video chat model. Frightened, she contacted her ex-boyfriend, who, in turn, notified the US Embassy in Bucharest.

After realizing that the evidence described crimes similar to organized crime, Buftea prosecutors declined jurisdiction to the Directorate for the Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism.

The investigators waited for the Tate brothers to return to Romania
For nine months, anti-mafia prosecutors put together all the evidence taken from the Tate brothers' villa and from the video chat studio, in order to be able to prove that the accusations made during the hearings by their alleged victims are real.

Sources close to the investigation stated, for Gândul , that shortly after the completion of the computer expertise, the authorities waited for the right moment to catch the Tate brothers, who were always out of the country.

After seeing, including on social networks, that they were together in Romania, the DIICOT prosecutors mobilized the special troops of the Gendarmerie and descended, by force, on their villa in Pipera, but also on other addresses.

The quoted sources stated that one of the searches targeted a former policewoman from the 7th Section, who left the Capital Police and started videochatting.

She is accused that, in addition to working side by side with the rest of the models, she would have taken care to put pressure on the girls held in the studio against their will. The woman was picked up and taken to DIICOT headquarters for questioning.",772,2022-12-29 16:11:51,Andrew Tate,To get away with Human Trafficking (Andrew Tate arrested)

jh5lfsx,12u7lf1,news,I_Also_Fix_Jets,"Full Article:

Controversial influencer Andrew Tate has had his house arrest extended for another 30 days by a Romanian court.

He was first arrested alongside his brother, Tristan, at their Bucharest home in December 2022.

On 31 March, he was moved from custody to house arrest following a ruling by a Romanian judge.

Charges still have not been brought against the brothers or the two Romanian associates who were arrested alongside them.

However, prosecutors are investigating the brothers for crimes of suspected human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women.

They have denied the allegations.

The two associates, Georgiana Naghel and Luana Radu, were also moved from prison detention into house arrest on 31 March.

All four were ordered to stay in the buildings where they live, unless they have judicial permission to leave.

It is unclear whether the other associates also had their house arrest extended on Friday.

The Tate brothers' latest extension to their house arrest means they cannot leave their homes before 29 May.

We are required by law to block certain types of content because we get federal funding to help pay for the Chromebooks and the internet access. The law is the Children's Internet Protection Act, CIPA. Part of what we must block is content ""harmful to minors."" What is harmful to minors is decided locally, by the school board or a designated authority. I am one of the designated authorities. It is literally my job (not mine alone and for some stuff including Andrew Tate I can and did present a case for blocking or allowing specific content to district management) to decide what to block. When there is a pedagogical reason to allow content that doesn't fall into strict blocking categories under CIPA we allow it.

EXCLUSIVE | Andrew and Tristan Tate, together with a former policewoman, detained for 24 hours in the case of human trafficking opened in the name of the two brothers. DIICOT + VIDEO clarifications from the searches and the exit from actual hearings
 
 
On Thursday, DIICOT prosecutors went to the house of a former policewoman from Bucharest, who is said to be part of the group specialized in human trafficking of brothers Tristan and Andrew Tate. The two Britons are suspected of exploiting several young women through a video chat studio set up near their villa in Pipera.

UPDATE 3 – DIICOT statement regarding this case:

""In the case, it was noted that, at the beginning of 2021, 4 suspects (two British citizens and two Romanian citizens) constituted a criminal group organized in order to commit the crime on the territory of Romania, but also of other countries, such as the USA and Great Britain of human trafficking.

The injured persons were recruited by British citizens by misrepresenting their intention to enter into a marriage/cohabitation relationship and the existence of real feelings of love (the «loverboy» method).

They were later transported and housed in buildings in Ilfov county where, by exercising acts of physical violence and mental coercion (through intimidation, constant surveillance, control and invoking alleged debts), they were sexually exploited by group members by forcing them to perform demonstrations pornographic for the purpose of producing and disseminating material of such a nature through social media platforms and by submitting to the execution of a work, in a forced manner, in order to obtain important financial benefits consisting of the sums of money obtained as a result of accessing the materials by users.

To date, 6 injured persons have been identified who were sexually exploited by the organized criminal group.

With regard to the crime of rape, it was noted that, in March 2022, an injured person was forced, on two different occasions, by a suspect through the exercise of physical violence and psychological pressure to have sexual relations.

At the headquarters of the Directorate for the Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism - Central Structure, 4 people who are reasonably suspected of being involved in criminal activity were taken for questioning.

Following the hearings, the prosecutors of the Directorate for the Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism - Central Structure ordered the measure of detention for a period of 24 hours against the 4 persons"".

UPDATE 2 – The Tate brothers and the former policewoman, detained for 24 hours

According to GANDUL sources, arrest warrants were issued for 24 hours for the Tate brothers, but also for the former policewoman involved in this case.

UPDATE – The searches in the case of the Tate brothers, accused of human trafficking along with a former policewoman, have ended. All three perpetrators were taken to DIICOT headquarters for questioning

The searches in the case of the British brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate, accused of human trafficking along with a former policewoman, ended on Thursday evening. All three perpetrators were taken to DIICOT headquarters for questioning .



Original news:

In this case, investigators first descended on the Pipera address of brothers Tristan and Andrew Tate on April 11, when a complaint was received at the US Embassy regarding the fact that a woman with American citizenship was being forcibly held at their residence.

Initially, the investigation was carried out by the Ilfov police, who immediately descended on their home, in a case opened under the coordination of the prosecutors of the Prosecutor's Office attached to the Buftea Court, for deprivation of liberty and rape.

On this occasion, the Romanian authorities learned that the British had a video chat studio , which operated in a building located approximately 500 meters from their villa. Several young women were found there, including the woman with American citizenship, but also a young woman from the Republic of Moldova.

The two are said to have said at the time that they were being held against their will after being rounded up using a method commonly used by human traffickers known generically as ""loverboy"".

In this regard, the young woman from America would have stated that she met Tristan Tate through a social network, and he would have seduced her and convinced her to buy a plane ticket and come to Romania.

She allegedly abandoned her boyfriend and came to live with the British millionaire, but found herself threatened and forced to work as a video chat model. Frightened, she contacted her ex-boyfriend, who, in turn, notified the US Embassy in Bucharest.

After realizing that the evidence described crimes similar to organized crime, Buftea prosecutors declined jurisdiction to the Directorate for the Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism.

The investigators waited for the Tate brothers to return to Romania
For nine months, anti-mafia prosecutors put together all the evidence taken from the Tate brothers' villa and from the video chat studio, in order to be able to prove that the accusations made during the hearings by their alleged victims are real.

Sources close to the investigation stated, for Gândul , that shortly after the completion of the computer expertise, the authorities waited for the right moment to catch the Tate brothers, who were always out of the country.

After seeing, including on social networks, that they were together in Romania, the DIICOT prosecutors mobilized the special troops of the Gendarmerie and descended, by force, on their villa in Pipera, but also on other addresses.

The quoted sources stated that one of the searches targeted a former policewoman from the 7th Section, who left the Capital Police and started videochatting.

She is accused that, in addition to working side by side with the rest of the models, she would have taken care to put pressure on the girls held in the studio against their will. The woman was picked up and taken to DIICOT headquarters for questioning.",13,2022-12-29 16:09:51,Andrew Tate,Andrew Tate’s has been arrested for human trafficking in Romania

I work as, among other things, a resilience counselor in the military. You have to 1) sever the immediate tie to the harmful influence, and 2) address whatever underlying issue is driving them to seek refuge in that community.

kxot93o,1btujui,australia,cleigh0409,"Primary school teacher here, it's horrifying being asked by 10 year old boys if I like Andrew Tate, and when I reply no they go on a big spiel about how great he is and how they want to be him when they grow up  What's worse is that I work at a school with a large Muslim population where we already have trouble with when it comes to respecting women, teachers , peers or otherwise 🙃",47,2024-04-02 05:36:44,Andrew Tate,"Andrew Tate's ideology driving sexual harassment, sexism and misogyny in Australian classrooms"
kxpbfmy,1btujui,australia,_Piratical_,"It’s all over. My wife lives in the Netherlands and was surrounded by a bunch of 13-14 year old boys who just said some of the most horrible sexual things to her in a group surrounding her. She was shocked and couldn’t believe what she was seeing in a normally really safe place (she was in a pet food store at the time!) she was told by an employee that the kids had been in before hassling women and bragging about being fans of Andrew Tate.

kxs9ovi,1btujui,australia,No_Entrepreneur_6707,"My biggest gripe with this segment and the way it was presented is as if Andrew Tate is the core issue.

He isn't. His ideology was borne from a broader societal shift in the last 20 or so years (in response partly to third wave feminism, where men felt like feminism wasn't fighting for female rights but to diminish their own) and is not his alone.

Additionally his would not have spread so far and wide in younger men if adult men (20+) hadnt ascribed and bought into it as well. He was bankrolled by subscriber and ad views   - most of which were grown ass adults buying his shit.

Looking broader at the Australian cultural climate of women being underpaid, underrepresented in leadership of schools, companies and politics alike, alongside our rampant DV stats - Andrew Tate is an easier place to put blame than the society that allowed him to do what he did.

In the piece two women left schools citing sexual harassment and feeling unsafe - those boys perpetrating the behaviours did not leave. The classroom is no safer for any other females - be it students or teachers there. 

This is a much bigger issue than Tate and it will require a reckoning to address.",10,2024-04-02 17:52:17,Andrew Tate,"Andrew Tate's ideology driving sexual harassment, sexism and misogyny in Australian classrooms"

I feel like this would happen regardless of his influence. I'm a guy and students were asking me personal questions when I was student teaching.

People like Andrew Tate **actively promote** unhealthy views on sex and relationships, **and** they’re far easier for children to gain access to than pornography.

kxojbew,1btujui,australia,the__distance,"Andrew Tate is a colossal fuckwit but I think part of the reason for his popularity is that he's unapologetically telling boys to be ambitious while a lot of education seems to be trying to teach kids to be apologetic for everyone else's actions. Even more broadly than that, there's a bigger trend to denigrate any public figures that have gone and achieved great things.
