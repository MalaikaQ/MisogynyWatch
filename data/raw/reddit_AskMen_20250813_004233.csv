n8damin,1momyo7,AskMen,AutoModerator,"Here's an original copy of /u/Future-Bet4783's post (if available):

I don’t know if it’s just me but as a 30 year old, I find myself not wanting to pursue relationships anymore consider how my last one failed due to finances being a big issue. Lack of money can create so many problems, especially with how transactional relationships feel today and with societal norms telling men that they are pure providers.

n8dty98,1momyo7,AskMen,alphachad00,"It’s an economic problem actually and comes down to what a man values the most:

Taking time and energy you could be spending on your career and instead spending it on a person is a consequential decision.

Taking earnings from your career that you could be investing into a house or securities and instead spending it on a person is also a consequential decision.

The person can change their mind about the relationship at a drop of a hat and decide to leave (or ruin it by cheating or something), and there’s not a thing you can do about it. Then it’s like starting all over again, and everything you put into that relationship was more or less a waste (disregarding learning experiences).

A decorated, sturdy, and promising career path and resume built over a number of years is permanent. It can’t leave you. You can get fired from a job, sure, but the experience still goes on with you. Not true for a relationship, where the memories and passion built with an ex do not continue on to future relationships. 

A sound portfolio of financial or physical assets do not leave you either. You own it and decide what to do with it. Not true with a relationship where the person is free to do whatever they want and all you can do is treat them right, trust them, and hope nothing changes.


Some people consider the things a relationship brings (love, intimacy, family, etc) a high enough priority that they’ll take on the risk of spending time, effort, or money on relationships that are statistically likely to fail at some point BEFORE establishing their career. Yes, most people would probably agree that true love is more important than the extra financial and career benefit that comes from the resources spent on looking for it. But the financial and career benefit is a more or less certain if you’re level headed (along with obvious freedom), and you can be sure that nearly every “positive” step you take is leading you in the right direction. On the other hand, finding true love that doesn’t lead to divorce, resentment and broken families is less than a 50% chance based on statistics. It’s impossible to know if a certain someone is the “right direction.” Moreover, who knows how long it’ll take. 

Now it’s just a decision of which path provides more utility (happiness) for a given cost (resources time, money, effort). The expected value of the relationship path is the probability of finding everlasting love (low) times the happiness gained from it (high). The expected value of the career/single path is the happiness piece times the probability (pretty much 100%). The marginal happiness gained using each unit of resources decreases the more you have of it (or the more successful you are in your career and single life). At some point, you will value the expected value of the relationship more and choose that path, unless the probability of finding love is zero for some reason.

A big variable in the expected value of the career path is one’s own potential. This is why someone who knows they can go very far in their career will be more likely to marry later than someone who knows that “total career grind” isn’t for them. This, I think, is why naturally high achieving people in higher ceiling career paths tend to marry when older.",6,2025-08-12 17:12:35,False,Should men bother with dating if they are not financially secure yet,172,2025-08-12 15:22:54,218,,,,,,[]

Money comes and goes, frankly.  People have ups and down, emotionally and financially.  You're asking a question similar to if a man should date after losing a loved one or something.  I mean, probably not, for the sake of the mental health of the man as well as the datee, but ultimately, it's up to those two people, not us.

If dating is an utter slog and numbers game you're only doing because you have to, and you know you're both handicapped by your financial situation, and that dating is actively making your financial situation worse, it's a pretty straight-forward question.

n8cwaxy,1moaae5,AskMen,Medium9,"In theory, if you don't hold on to each other, yes. But then also in theory, the space you'll be in will be confined, and both of you will eventually bounce into a barrier in your trajectory.

Ignoring heat losses to plastic deformation and air friction (similar concepts in this case), you both would bounce back from these at about the same velocity. Assuming perfectly parallel surfaces on each ond of that space, you're guaranteed to meet again, with the same energy as before.

This is of course making a lot of assumptions about minor influences of ""epsilon-sized"" quantities, but hey! That's how we've done serious and profound science for centuries, right!?

Edit: Also, in theory, if you both don't want to become bored as hell eventually, you'll probably heat up the surrounding air to fry you both, through friction, WAY before any sexual satisfaction on either side happens. (Or speed each other up so much, that you'll just die from hitting just about anything.) Just keeping a good grip from the start sounds infinitely easier xD

Edit 2: I'm having the wildest images of wildly speeding humans in the ISS from here to there, occasionally ""hitting it"" once every other hour or so, gleefully moaning when it happens, but otherwise sweating ever more to make reaching the water station a MUCH better sounding target, eventually both drowning in each other's sweat while zooming about at 100km/h being all bruised and broken-boned...

n8fbasz,1mowt02,AskMen,789_ba_dum_tss,"to be honest, I wish I started a family at 28. I am 36 now, have no family and my partner of 13 years who i had a wonderful life with and we agreed to start a family at 35 decided she didn't want kids anymore. so we are separated. so to be honest it sucks haha. 

BUT I am a likable person, I take care of myself, and I love people in general. So I'm not worried about finding a loving partner again that wants a family - I am just bummed that they aren't going to have young grandparents and a younger dad who has more energy. So I have been going to gym like crazy (not for looks) but purely for my unborn children. I want to be the healthiest i can be for as long as possible to be the energetic father I wanted to be when I was in my 20s.

Keep in mind, though, I feel I have one purpose in this life and it is to be a husband and father. Which might not be how you feel. I never cared about money so much, career so much. I work hard and stuff, but none of it fulfils me. I constantly have friends over for dinner parties because I feel I need to take care of someone. I want to cook for them, host them, make sure they are happy. I feel life is utterly uneventful now and so easy being now single and childless in my mid 30s. I don't worry about money. I don't worry about time. I don't worry about anyone or anything. I have nothing to care for but myself.

>I’m a 26 year old single guy who’s being pressured left and right by most guys who are the same age and above to have a family. I know I will have it soon BUT I’m not financially and emotionally ready to have a family.

Who are they? Do they know if you're ready to have kids both mentally and financially? If you're not ready, you're not ready. If you don't want to, then don't do it.
Not everyone is cut out for this shit.

In this economy, getting married and having kids is not something to take lightly. It can make it break your life. You need to start practicing how to say ""fuck it"" more often. Fuck what your peers say. If they chastise your for not being married cut them off. The last thing I want is for you to end up on r/regretfulparents. The last thing I want for you is

n8fc05z,1mowt02,AskMen,Prettychilledoutguy,"I am late 30s single and living the best life.

The pro of no kids/wife is really that I get to live my best life and guaranteed peace and quiet.  Financially while I don't have the burden/pressure of providing, I also don't have as much motivation since I am very comfortable financially with no one to support.   I would recommend holding on family/commitment until after you turn 30, things look are lot clearer as to where your career is going and what you want out of life, dating also starts to flip in your favor as ladies age into their 30s and your career is more established.  You will be more emotionally and financially ready.  Go to the gym now for it to pay off when you turn 30.

The con of having no kids/wife at my age is probably that if I get married when I am 40, it is likely that when my kid turns 18 I will be quite old like 60 years old.  There is also a physical constraint that in my 40s I will be tired much earlier than if I was in my 30s for bring up my child.  That being said after I got out of a long term relationship I had way more time to gym/exercise and I'm in the best shape of my life.

I had a long term relationship until about a year ago where marriage and kids were all on the cards before it went to shit. 

Now I: 
- Make more money and keep more of what I make, because I have full control over where it goes. No expensive dates, no presents to make her happy, no maintaining two cars, renting a smaller flat is enough etc. 
- I have the time and peace of mind to learn new skills and do trainings - since I am in control. 
- I have done more self-healing work than I ever have, because I can truly self-reflect and work on myself when I am alone and have no one else to care for. 

Sure I want a family some day - but I am very thankful that I didn’t bite the bullet and become a married man with kids in my 20s. All this opportunity for advancement I have now would’ve never come.

n8f4zan,1mov3xt,AskMen,brooksie1131,Honestly for most guys it's isn't muscles that are necessarily a turn off. It's the low body fat percentage. I know a woman who did a body building contest and she look fairly good until she cut super hard right before the contest. Apparently that is the desired look but honestly its disgusting. Don't get me wrong there are certainly guys who are into shredded women but I think it's not the norm. If you are in the normal body fat percentage range then having decent muscles is typically attractive at least to me.

n8b5rbg,1mobhli,AskMen,b1jan,"My current girlfriend is into astrology.

Like, really, really into it. To a degree to which i've never even seen a hint of before. she puts most 'astrologers' to shame in the depth of her knowledge about astrology and the cultures and history around it.

Like, she has textbooks (multiple) that are THICK, reads into the various cultures and their histories of it, looks at birth charts of any mildly interesting person, and compares it to their careers, including but not limited to F1 drivers, business people, presidents, pretty much anyone of note that has crossed our lives.

It's.. fine. She doesn't base decisions on it (although when I had a leak from my water tank she found it humorous that Uranus was in the like something house idk, and that's associated with water and things being in places they shouldn't or something). she describes it as divination, and a way of reading into the tendencies of the universe, in its cyclical nature. she never says 'oh thats so pisces of you' or any of that shit, although she has asked to know my birth time (i haven't found it, despite trying) to map my past life events against my star chart at that point in my life. i am mildly interested, and will continue to try to make this happen out of intrigue. she has also tried to estimate my birth time based on my description of my life, which is a fun exercise i am playing into a bit.

I try to pay attention, genuinely, and while it seems true that you can find something related in the stars for almost any situation, i guess that's kind of the point? 

I look at it with no hostility, and if she finds it interesting, it's no less real than the drama happening in F1 for me. she too is annoyed by pedestrian crystal hippies who are into the 'fake' astrology that is based on the month you're born- she says that unless you're looking at birth chart down to the minute of birth, it's almost entirely irrelevant.

idk, what's the big deal? there are far worse things to be into, and being open minded about this sort of thing helps you practice being open minded about all things, and that can ONLY be a good practice, good for your mind, and good for your happiness.

edit: i'll also point out that she is not actually at all lacking in skepticism, she's not anti-science or anything, is actually quite intelligent, quite nerdy, into punk and counterculture, philosophy, theology, very intellectual, and extremely analytical. she says she got into astrology as a way to debunk it, but keeps finding it annoyingly compelling, as she digs deeper.",514,2025-08-12 09:08:07,False,"Men who dated women who were into astrology, how did it go?",137,2025-08-12 08:15:43,141,,,,,,[]

They’re the same who do things with tarot and crystals and seeing what they do with that it’s to help them think in other ways rather than saying this is the answer, which is what religions also tend to do by forcing one set way as the correct.

n8bpctv,1mobhli,AskMen,yungsimba1917,"Nonbinary person here! It’s been the same as any self-justifying belief. People who are into astrology want to have a justification for things they already believe the same way that any other religion (which yes I do consider astrology a religion) does. Sometimes these people won’t be able to properly communicate their reasons for placing expectations or stereotypes outside of astrology but really they’re just going off their personal experiences. That said, even people who “aren’t that into astrology” will place expectations or stereotypes on you consciously & subconsciously. For example I’ve heard people who “don’t take astrology seriously but just want to have fun” say things like “why is it always [sign] [gender],” “it seems like all my friends are [sign],” “you’re not like other [signs],” “I’ve never met a [sign] who [actions] before!” All these phrases taken in isolation appear innocuous but reveal that humans are pattern matching machines & try as you might, you’ll never be free from forming preconceived notions of what a [sign] is like & what you expect from them if astrological signs are something you place any amount of importance on.

That said, I’ve met people into astrology who used it to magnify their positive outlooks on people by being understanding, helpful & caring as much as I’ve seen it magnify their negative outlooks on people by being narcissists, racists, & gossips.",-2,2025-08-12 10:44:13,False,"Men who dated women who were into astrology, how did it go?",137,2025-08-12 08:15:43,141,,,,,,[]

n8bn9aq,1mobhli,AskMen,tiddertnuocca519,"I’m not a spiritual person but my mom is Hindu and they have a lot of astrology stuff going on there. I always wonder if these westerners would find Hindu astrology far more interesting. It’s got several thousands of years on western Astrology, has a ton of old stories connected to them and is quite interesting. I’m an Athiest and I don’t believe any of it but it is kinda fun to explore. I think part of it is just peering into the minds of philosophers from thousands of years ago and seeing how they view the world.

I think HealthyGamerGG, a psychiatrist that did his residency at Harvard Medical School, will occasionally dip his toes into spirituality, meditation and some of the old Hindu folk lore. I really am not a spiritual person and I don’t think Hinduism is the fact of the world…but some exploration of this stuff has been healing. Whether it’s just meditating and calming myself and doing anxiety management or just listening to how others perceive the world and applying it to my non-spiritual view of the world. To be clear, HealthyGamerGG isn’t preachy or trying to convert people. More so applying the stories and creating connections to psychiatry - which is just about the most spirituality I can tolerate, so it works for me.

I really do think religion is largely a crock of shit but there are small things I think can be taken, to apply to one’s life, if they are willing to be open.

n8eh7jd,1moqu3v,AskMen,TellAnn56,"Being young can be weird & we’re all different, so, from my perspective as an adult & having gone through a tough teenage time, all I can say is try to find something to believe in & most importantly, believe in yourself.  Take care of yourself, sounds like your family is under some stress.  There are people out there that really care about you & having sudden outbursts of uncontrollable rage sounds concerning, & I think it is to you also, because you reached out to this site with your question.  If you can talk to your dad, an uncle, an old coach, a teacher or one of your friend’s fathers, I would advise that.  Also, places like the Salvation Army, some churches & community centers have options for you to talk to somebody.  You’re young, so ‘Professional’ can mean anything from a Social Worker to a Psychologist to a Psychiatrist.  Social Workers & Psychologists are trained professionals but they don’t prescribe medications, they only talk, & honestly, it can really help.  They’re non-judgmental, usually really open to listening to thoughts you might have that you think are weird & that you will be judged negatively for, but believe me, most likely they’ve already heard something very similar before.  Being what State you’re in, you may need permission from a parent to talk to a Social Worker or a Psychologist, but some States you won’t.  You wont know until you make contact with them.  Don’t be so afraid to take reach out to somebody you like, who you trust.  I think you mull be pleasantly surprised about how that person probably really cares for you, but, also, as life goes, don’t be surprised or upset if you hit a few rejections - that’s just life & we all have had many rejections & been disappointed in the responses we expected from other people.  Anyway, take care of yourself.  Be kind & forgiving to yourself.  Reach out, take the chance(s) to find & get what you need.  But, although video games can be a distraction, you won’t find any answers there.  If you want help, you’ve gotta reach out to somebody, I suggest you begin with your father, an uncle, a teacher, a school counselor, a coach, new or old, a religious figure (if religion matters to you), you can walk into a hospital ER or a clinic or your family’s physician, even your mother’s physician may be a good place to start.

n8fa45q,1mowsf1,AskMen,AutoModerator,"Here's an original copy of /u/hottottie21's post (if available):

So I’m 32 years old and I’m just now starting to date and I have no idea what I’m doing or how to do it. I’m mainly embarrassed and scared men will judge me for it. Either think I’m a loser or that there’s something major wrong with me and that’s why I’ve been single for so long. 

A little info. Ive only been in one long term relationship and that was in high school for 2 years. He did a little number on me and I couldn’t let him go for a few years. I got over him completely but never dated as I’ve just been insecure and just honestly didn’t care to put any effort In and I’ve been okay being by myself and over time I just got used to it. I’ve had a few very short flings with a few men over the last decade but just because I was bored. I’ve recently lost weight and worked on myself and I feel good about myself and I’m ready to date as I am lonely. 

My main fears are that I don’t know how to date, what’s appropriate and what’s not in stages, how to explain why I’ve been single without looking weird, being judged and looking like a loser, and really I just don’t know how to be in a relationship. Especially now as an adult and how that would be.

I’ve also been so self sufficient and have been by myself for so long that I had lost my feminine energy and I’m not as soft as most girls are as I’ve been protecting myself for so long. I’ve worked on that and I feel like I’m a softer woman now. It’s just hard to let my guard down so I don’t want to scare anyone away either. 

I’m a very giving, caring and thoughtful person and I would never cheat or do anything but be the best girlfriend. So I know I have a lot to offer. But what are your thoughts on this and how would you feel about dating someone like me?

That's my take as a 30yr old man but I'm also not single so idk about the single guys.


The only issue is see is that you may not know what your wants and needs are in a relationship, that's something you work out along the way.


for expample for me It's simple good and regular sex, good company, mutual interests and hobbies, I need me time as much as us time everything needs a balance, I prefer a more slightly co-dependent woman but must be independent financially in the early days of the relationship whereas at the point my partner and I are at idc i make more and I provide as i prefer traditional general roles and a traditional relationship, I'm kinky and like for those things to align, the main pillars of any good relationship for me is trust, respect, honesty and communication, have to be open to marriage and children, I don't have interests in those who go out drinking and partying every weekend as friends or as a partner, general hygiene, emotional maturity i refuse to be someone's emotional punching bag when they've had a bad day this has been the reason I have literally packed exs bags for them and showed them the door. My friends are important to me if you don't like me hanging with them or you just don't like them without giving them a go big red flag on the inverse I will return the same favour and trust in my partners judgement of character and give her friends a fair go.

- You say you’re scared/ have no idea how to do it. So just find a manly man and let the guy lead everything 

- Try to communicate your inexperience as soon as possible. Guys find that sexy as automatically being a bit older now is going to subconsciously come with the belief that you’ve been ho’ing around and are finally ready to settle down. Not having years of dating under you is a PLUS not a negative 

- Like you said just try to be soft and feminine / look your best and be sweet and that’s all you have to do. If you are having trouble meeting people just be more aggressive in public with potential dudes.

n8fc7ba,1mowsf1,AskMen,Xenosith,"In most cases with a lot of things, including dating (for me at least), confidence comes with a bunch of practice, so it's perfectly understandable that getting into dating can feel a bit daunting.

I would say the best thing is to do your best managing your feelings surrounding rejection, because the reality is that it absolutely will happen. There's also going to be a lot of things that happen that don't make any logical sense at all (it's people you're dating after all), and it's important to be able to manage how you handle that, particularly with how you view yourself and not allowing your rejections form your identity or reflect who you are as a person. 9 times out of 10, rejections a blessing in disguise, and the healthiest way forward is accepting that that person at any given point isn't for you, no matter how little sense it makes or how you felt about them.

I would also say it's important to trust your gut instinct when it comes to meeting up with people as well. Maintaining your own expectations and what you want from a partner will help you keep on track with finding someone that is actually good for you and will meet your needs. I'll also say to trust your instincts while in the company of others in order to maintain your own physical safety as well.

Underneath and behind all of that - have fun! It's your experience just as much as anyone elses, so making the most of it will definitely ease some of the tension for you.

To your question - personally, I simply wouldn't care at all if you're only just deciding to start dating. Everyone has their own life, and if the answer to the question ""why haven't you dated?"" is ""I didn't want to until now"", then that's as good an answer as any as far as I'm concerned.

n8ffb5o,1mowsf1,AskMen,edddy1270,"Omg girl I’m 28M and haven’t started yet either 💀 the thought of dating is scary to me because idk how to talk to girls in a flirty way, give signals and all that because all my life I never really had a group of friends that were consistent to even talk and socialize with and learn from them how to, it was always temporary friends, never really was the party type and going out was not my thing, I’m a loner and an introvert at heart, so when all I’ve ever had were girls as friends I truly don’t know how to love someone like romantically, 

and yes I have that same mindset as you where I think I’m a loser and embarrassed to even say it to anyone and surprisingly they never asked either, and frankly I’ve never told anyone that I’ve been single and a virgin never dated or kissed, whenever people talk about relationships or gf/bf or dating I avoid the conversation at my job, because I don’t want to be asked questions and have to expose myself, 

but yea I also feel at the same time never really cared or payed any mind to anyone in public, like yes whenever I go out I see people that are cute but would never care, so like yea I’ve been okay alone but I wanna start just don’t know where to start or what to do and what to say just feel lost in life, 

omg we are literally twins cause I feel the same way about you saying you don’t know how to be in a relationship, because how do I know what to do as a boyfriend, like how do I maintain the relationship what’s the right things to do when it’s your first time ever, and what not to do, it’s just the unknown of being with someone forever and it being the first time, and it’s just like I’m I good enough for someone, I feel like I would need someone to approach me and lead the relationship in the very beginning and that has experience and isn’t judging and patient with us

n8fh80v,1mowsf1,AskMen,Riztrain,"I think you just need a little guidance on the how-to, and not the dating in and of itself, that part is easy, just put yourself out there, grab a dude and ask him on a date that only happens in the movies and to maybe 1000 men across the globe every year, so go for it! 

It'll give you a great first impression on the dudes and you'll sort out the bad ones, because the ones who would say no either just aren't interested and it's better to know than to hope, or they're put off by your confidence and self respect and would prefer to be ""in charge"". That's where you find the jealous and controlling types.

The ones who say yes will feel very validated and appreciative, as well as be impressed by you and likely respect you way more.

As for the how-to, and this is what I tell my own daughter, remember rule number 0-10: do NOT do anything you don't want to, feels inappropriate, or makes you uncomfortable in even the slightest bit. And I'm not talking about going on a horse and carriage ride, but anything regarding your date itself. If you don't want to hold hands and they try to, tell them politely you don't feel comfortable with that yet. If they try to kiss or hold you in any way and you don't want that yourself, tell them.

Then comes rule number 11: don't do anything because you feel like you should. This harkens back to the first set, be confident, you're not there for *their* enjoyment, you're there for both of you to enjoy your date. And if they try to kiss you or propose sex and you feel like you have to but would prefer not, or even feel indifferent, then do. Not. Do. It. Save it for another time when you both want to, and you'll both enjoy it way more.

Lastly the biggest single rule of them all: if a single ""no"" is not respected, then stop the date there. If you're telling them you don't want to, for example, hold hands and they insist or push for it, or ignore you and do it anyway, then stop the date, this is not the one.

If you want a good date, and meet someone you'll truly be happy with, maybe for the rest of your life, then remember that you *need* mutual respect, and that can be sorted the first hour of your time together.

Needless to say, but all these rules work in reverse too, don't force them to do anything, and respect their boundaries.

EVERY one gave them the side eye except for me and my wife.  We could see they loved each other.  She had kids from a previous marriage and she, was really i guess his first real love?  He never married until her.  Sure, he had lots of GF’s before (he was a cop, and dang good looking)..  Nobody could figure it out.  But I could see that spark in his eye with her.  And she was pretty apprehensive about their relationship. But..  He pushed, got married, I could always tell she was nervous about what it looked like.  But they worked and it all worked out.  

Everyone was worried that she would get old and die before him…. Nope.  turns out he got the VID and died before the vaccine came out.  F-in sucks.  

What they had was love man..  you see lightning in a bottle. You just know it.  They had it. 

Sure there is allot of things to consider with age disparage marriages.  But, caution be told… you do not know how it will work out.

When I was 26 and she was 37, I started to wonder what would happen when I was 39 and she was 50? I've always taken care of myself physically and nutrition wise, and she wasn't like that, especially  as she aged. I had to decide that if I was going to break her heart; was I going to do it early with honesty,  and break it off clean, or later in life, possibly succumbing to temptation and cheating on her. She was fully aware that another younger host from another show on her network was not shy about showing her interest in me. It was a stressful situation as there was no loyalty or respect in her line of work, and she noticed that I was constantly being tempted. She predicted the breakup due to the age difference 3 years before it happened. I was too naive and in love to see it, but she was ultimately right. She called it. But she was so mature and understanding about it. I'll never forget our last night together before moving out when she told me that she loved me and wanted me to find true happiness, whether it was with her or without her and I think she was the one who made me realize that true love is selfless and never selfish.  And I've carried that lesson with me and in other relationships after her. Letting people go and letting them be happy and not forcing them to stay for my own selfish needs.  I'll always appreciate her for everything she taught me in my younger years.  I'm 47 now, and she's 58.

n8e9n57,1momb3d,AskMen,No-Bus-4529,"Over time i began to notice a deeply embedded complex with her and aging. Talking about prior relationships she was somewhat jaded towards men which makes sense if you're 55 and still looking for ""the one"", but why? And then when she told me her last 3 ex's were in their mid 20s it all made sense. She complained about how they were lazy, immature, loved playing video games, partying, etc. So really it was her own fault for choosing them but i know she felt a sense of pride for still being hot enough to pull men half of her age. She initially thought i was in my 20s because i looked younger than my age at the time. She liked young men, and they would pad her aging ego making her feel temporarily young again until her patience wore out because they were more or less, children, compared to her life experience and maturity. A hot, mature, highly successful, yet low self esteem woman who's youth faded away long ago and struggled to accept that time was no longer on her side. 

This carried over into our own relationship because her underlying insecurity and jealousy was off the charts, threatened by any woman who might have been younger than her.

She also had 4 grown kids from her 1st marriage, all around my age and 1 who was older than me, which i felt extremely weird about because he had daggers in his eyes anytime he'd see me. She also had several grandkids on top of that. Realistically seeing this huge family i knew in my heart there was no way in hell i was going to be a makeshift step dad and grand dad to all of these people at the ripe age of 35. I'm sure the younger guys she dated felt the same way too and she really wanted that in a partner since she was so family oriented. 

One thing i also felt weird about was later on i found out the reality company she owned was legit, however, she was in reality a slum lord. Her property advertisements were all over the ghettos of my city, taxing poor folks for shit, unmaintained properties. She spent half of her weeks at our downtown courthouses battling lawsuits from tenants who constantly sued her for negligence. She spent so much time at court that she eventually bought herself a brand new luxury condo downtown just because it saved her the commute. 

Sex was phenomenal though, met her many times after hours at her office building since she was the last one there working most nights and christened in her desk, breakroom tables, and reception area couches. She had porn worthy skills easy. 

But i know in the end her short fuse, blowing things out of proportion, and ultimately the family thing tanked us. Oh well, fun while it lasted 👍",23,2025-08-12 18:47:50,False,"Men who dated women older than you, what was the age difference and how did it go?",38,2025-08-12 14:56:29,68,,,,,,[]

Most of these questions can easily be answered by swapping the sexes because you know the answer why women do it, and the answer for why men do isn’t that different. 

Why do men cheat? For the same reasons women do, selfishness, being unfulfilled in their relationship, emotional issues. 

It’s just that they don’t want the answers to be the same. Because people like to think that, like in the cheating example, a woman only cheats when her man is falling short, (which is nonsense but good enough for this explanation.) If that’s true, and men and women are more or less the same, that means women fall short in a relationship too resulting in him cheating.

n8a62fv,1mo7n9k,AskMen,KYRawDawg,"Many times men do this because I just want to get off. They rationalize it as not cheating because they're not actually meeting in real life. Now it's the total opposite when it comes to a gay guy, gay guys automatically think this is cheating and it makes me laugh as a gay guy myself. But I'll keep it to the straight community. Men are visual people, they will jerk off to a spread open woman as fast as I can. Because they feel it's not the act of cheating, they're OK with it and in many cases never have any intentions of hooking up with someone in real life on the side. It's a way to just get rid of their sexual frustrations and it helps them to feel good to know that a hopefully woman on the other side of the conversation is showing some interest in them where they might have a boring sex life with their current partner or spouse.

When I think about it, it's just the next step of progression from being addicted to pornography. Being able to have somebody who they hope is a female on the other side of the phone text them back with a slutty picture is better to them than just sitting there stroking to a fantasy while they're watching pornography. 

Is this an OK behavior in the heterosexual world? Probably not. I know if the shoe was on the other foot and it was the wife pleasuring herself to a picture of a man's penis on a text message conversation, the husband would no doubt get extremely jealous Especially if the guy was more endowed than he is.

n8b0rjq,1mo7n9k,AskMen,Antique_Soil9507,"Sexting addiction is a thing. 

Addiction. Related to OCD. A thought, becomes a text. Much more easily done than say renting a hotel room to meet someone for the weekend. 

At what point does texting become sexting or become cheating?

I had an ex who would very, very rarely text. She would withhold affection and support. She would ""disappear"" for 2-3 days at a time. 

When I would bring this up she would deflect, dismiss, or blame me.

But she also was forbidding me from ever texting anyone else from the opposite sex. She said just texting another girl would be ""cheating"".

Needless to say, that relationship didn't work out. 

But, sure. There's a reason people do it. They aren't getting the love/connection/support that they need or crave.  

Many self-righteous people who claim it is a failure as a human being. But it's not. And those people have never found themselves in that situation.  

A relationship is a dynamic. Many people don't want love, they want control. Similar to above: She didn't want me to text other women. But *she* wasn't texting me. I needed support. I needed care. Those were my needs in the relationship, which were ignored. 

So she can go around and pretend like I'm an evil person for texting other girls. But I don't think it's that simple. She was withholding love and affection. That is a form of control, and over time it is a form of abuse.

 Posh London/Hugh Grant-style voices from British men in their late 30s to mid 40s stop me in my tracks, doubly so when using simple phrases you probably take for granted like saying ""darling"".

n8cu6e6,1mojzf2,AskMen,yungingr,"It's not as bad as we like to make it out to be.  My doctor prescribes SuPrep - it's a 16 oz glass of solution, and you chase it with another 16 oz.  Supposed to do that within 30 min or an hour, starting about 6:00 the night before (they will give you the exact times a day or two before your appointment - you do the first dose like 12 hours before your appointment, and a second dose 4 hours before or something like that)

In my experience, it's best if you can get all 32 oz down in a minute.  Pour the prep solution into a glass, have a second glass with water ready.  Absolutely SLAM the first glass - it is the most disgustingly sweet shit you've ever drank in your life.  Get it all down before your brain has time to process it, and chase it with the glass of water immediately.

Once you've got that down, you've got about 30-45 minutes.  Get your affairs in order.  Don't leave the house, and if you don't live alone, try to have one bathroom designated as 'yours' for the next 12 hours.  When the first wave hits, don't be in any rush to wipe - just figure on spending 20-30 minutes for your first go.  Keep up on your fluids, but like another comment mentioned - watch for colors.  Nothing blue, red, or purple.  Sprite and 7 up are your friend.

After you've started the prep, be very, very careful trusting a fart for the next 18 hours.

n8dvkbj,1mojzf2,AskMen,Funandgeeky,"Lemon and Lime Jello are your friend. You feel like you're eating and it does fill you up.

Get that pho broth and heat it in a mug. (I used regular broth and it was okay but not as good. I should have gotten pho broth and next time I will.)

A bidet is your friend. If you don't have one, see if you can get a bidet attachment that you install under the seat. You can often get them from a hardware store or even Target or Wal-Mart. Trust me, you will want it and it's a lot easier on you than constant wiping.

The day of the procedure, you'll still need to empty out the rest of the liquid in you. While most came out the night before, there's always a little remaining the morning of. So make sure you get it out before you head to the procedure. 

It's not going to be a fun day, but you will survive. And no matter what happens, you'll be grateful you did it because either you get a clean bill of health, or they found something and took care of it so it's no longer a ticking time bomb.

25m. so today I took my mom to her breast cancer doctor’s appointment and upon walking up to the waiting room to check in, immediately this lady checking in at the front desk immediately catches my attention. she was just damn cute. fun sized, dressed in a pink outfit and to top it off, her hair was cut shoulder length short. her appointment must’ve been later than my moms, because my mom went in and came out and she was still yet to be called when we left. anyways, both of us ended up sitting in the waiting room together, backs against each other the whole 30 minutes my mom was with the nurse. funnily enough, within that timeframe i ended up getting up to “blow my nose” to get a better look at her and to see if she would glance over but no reaction. probably for the best because there was no reaction when i walked in the room with my mom. at the same time, people got placed to be and stuff to do, so i really didn’t want to bother her. just part of me really wanted to compliment how good she looked, small talk, and to grab her number. the pent up emotions were so bad I had to tell my mom hahaha.

I'm guessing you either accompanied your mother to a Gynecologist's office or oncology (depending if your mom is diagnosed or was just getting a routine breast exam, I didn't really get it). This is absolutely not a place to pick up a woman - at least it's quite weird to do it there.. Either she was having an appointment herself or waiting for a loved one's appointment to be over, both which don't really put you in the mood to be complimented or be ""picked up"" by a guy. These doctor's appointments are crucial and sometimes even nerve-wracking! 

If I had been there and noticed what you were doing I would've even arched an eyebrow at you. Of course not in offense since you weren't being completely inappropriate,

When lasagna noodles are done, **save the water**, add the noodles to the main pot. Add the remaining lasagna water until the main pot is nearly full. Cook slow (below boiling) for at least 30 minutes.

Serve the soup, grate the mozzarella on top and the fresh basil garnish after that.

I swear I have had chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes alllll over the US in various restaurants.  There are some that are really good, but none are as good as hers.  

She’s actually made it for a famous chef (TV show guy).  He thought it was just as amazing and was not really a southern cooking guy and wanted  her to bring it on his show.  She noped out because then it wouldn’t be special if everyone knew it.  Same with a couple of her other desert recipes. Over the years, I’ve told her a thousand times she could make bank do her thing.  She just doesn’t want that.  

She learned from her grandmother, and she has taught our DD some of them.  And for all of those recipes, the ingredients matter, but really is the technique that takes it to the next level.  And you can’t write that down, you have to see it, do it, figure out what you did wrong last time and do better the next. 

I would put her chocolate chip cookies, and Pecan / Apple Pies up against anyone anywhere anytime.  

Man she can cook the heck of stuff.  When she want’s to.  She doesn’t like to do it, if she can’t do it right, and it’s allot of work to do it.

Also I feel like grilled carrots are overlooked. Slice down the middle, cover in olive oil, salt and pepper and grill for a few minutes on each side. You can roast carrots for similar results but I like the grill better. Either way, you're bringing out the natural sweetness for a super easy, healthy and delicious side.

The trick is to choose your rest with intention, instead of defaulting into it or apologising for it. When you own your downtime, it stops feeling like wasted time.

n886p80,1mnx2ze,AskMen,Rom2814,"I have NEVER felt comfortable in fancy places - grew up poor in WV, spent years getting rid of 95% of my accent. (I don’t even know how to define “rich“ anymore but I frequently am in situations where I’m at a fancy restaurant or hotel, especially for business trips.)

I feel VERY uncomfortable being waited on.

Funny story: first fancy I ever had was at a hotel in Atlanta in the 80’s (The Peachtree Plaza, don’t know if it’s fancy or any good now) - I was 20 and the fanciest place I‘d been before that was Ponderosa (places like that and Bonanza were fancy, once a year kind of dinner for my family).

Anyway, my wife-to-be and I went out for a date while at a conference in Atlanta - we got a shrimp cocktail appetizer and they brought out a little bowl of water with a lemon slice in it afterward. I thought it was some kind of “lemon soup” and started to taste it before my wife stopped me and told me it was to dip my fingers in… I couldn’t believe it, seemed like such a bizarre “rich person” thing (she was not anywhere near rich but hadn’t grown up as poor and backward as I did).

One other one - prior to that dinner we had eaten at a sit down place in Ohio (not as fancy, but fancier than what I had ever gone to) - I ordered a pasta dish that had shrimp in it and they came with the tails on. I’d never had shrimp before and didn’t know you weren’t supposed to eat the tails… so I crunched my way through them. After dinner she asked if I liked it and I said that the shrimp were good except for the tails - she thought that was hilarious. (She still married me anyway.)

So… I’ve learned a little in the last 40 years, but I still do NOT feel comfortable in fancy places and I end up feeling bad for the people waiting on me. I watch how other people are with the staff at a restaurant and I just can’t bring myself to act like they do (I probably annoy the waiter and water person by thanking them every time they bring something).",15,2025-08-11 20:13:00,False,"Men who grew up poor but now considered rich, how did you overcome the feeling of ""I don't belong here"" in elite spaces?",221,2025-08-11 19:44:12,125,,,,,,[]

Most wealthy people grew up with wealth, or at least comfort, and I find most of them kind of shallow. I don't share their interests or priorities or need to prove themselves, and to be honest I kind of pity most of them. They are insecure because they've never been tested.

n897ugp,1mnx2ze,AskMen,eaz135,"You don’t get over it, and tbh you never truly fit in.

Through a mixture of grit, hard work and a lot of luck, I managed to land a graduate job with one of the top management consulting firms in the world, back in 2009. After a handful of years a group of us from the same grad intake broke out and created our own venture. With the same group we built up two separate ventures, with an exit through acquisition both times. I’m currently sitting on a 8 figure new worth, a lot of which is highly liquid assets / cash.

Out of that founding group, the other guys came from your typical Ivy League background, wealthy parents in professions like law, military, medicine etc. My parents were both teachers, and I went to a very average school.

During this experience I’ve had with both businesses, I’ve spent A LOT of time with very high net worth individuals, C-suite executives, PE / VC folks, etc. Honestly - watching my other cofounders casually speak with these guys was like I was listening to another language at times, I often had very little to relate with them, whereas the other founders seemed to just click with them.

Meanwhile - where my specialty really helped the business was I was often forward-deployed with our most important clients, in the trenches - making sure they actually delivered successfully and became advocates of our business. Typically in the trenches I clicked super well with the people, I felt at home in that environment as it was mostly filled with people of my background.

We ended up in a grove of “you guys deal with the PE folk, I’ll make sure our shit actually works and the client teams are happy”.

Those guys are often hosting extravagant parties at their homes, and the guests are always talking about things that my group of friends would throw up to. The conversations seem to constantly revolve around how good they all are, their successes, accomplishments - it seems like people can’t say a single sentence without saying something that tries to elevate their status. TBH it makes me sick. I tolerated those environments out of necessity - because I often had to spend time with those folk as a part of our business operations, the M&A processes, Board meetings, etc.

So to answer your question - no, I haven’t adapted to belonging to that group, nor do I want to - as it somewhat sickens me.

I continue to live a very minimal life, I have a modest house in a suburban area, I have one nice car (Tesla Model S), one nice watch (my wedding piece) - everything else in my life is modest, and one of my biggest challenges is convincing myself that it’s OK to spend my money. In the grocery store when I feel like a snack I’ll go for the item that’s discounted and 50c cheaper. I haven’t updated my shoes in about 3 years - they are still going strong.

Hey guys,

I’m curious if anyone has been in a situation where an ex partner completely changed your perspective on sex. I’ve been with over 50 women, but there was one ex who just unlocked a whole new level of sexual compatibility and freedom. She was a certified freak (or maybe we were just incredibly compatible), but either way, the experience was next-level.

After we broke up, I’ve found it difficult to match that same level of satisfaction with anyone else. It’s not about being picky, but that connection was so unique and intense that it’s hard to shake off. I’m wondering how others have dealt with this. Do you just settle for less, or have you found ways to compensate and move on from that experience?

n8a81xg,1mnqd1u,AskMen,MaineMan1234,"My first girlfriend with whom I lost my virginity LOVED sex. We learned about it together, she had her first PIV orgasm with me, then her first PIV orgasm in missionary.  She wanted sex every day. And she loved me very much, and SHOWED it every time we made love.  She was not “batshit crazy” like in others experiences mentioned here. We were extremely compatible in bed and outside. 

But she was my first and I didn’t know how unique she was, so I broke up with her after 3 years. 

And then learned the hard way that other women were not like her.  Actually my assumption that other women would love sex as much as her caused a lot of problems in other relationships. 

I was in a 23 year marriage with a 15 year dead bedroom. It was depressing and miserable. I stayed until the kids were old enough. 

Then I heard that the ex was getting divorced.  I made my move and we’ve been back together for almost 5 years.  Having hot passionate sex daily even in our 50s (helps that we’re both very fit for our age). 

I will die with this beautiful woman in my arms.",57,2025-08-12 06:13:35,False,How Do You Cope After an Ex Who Raised the Bar on Sexual Compatibility?,325,2025-08-11 14:50:55,149,,,,,,[]
n86qju3,1mnqd1u,AskMen,GreatResetBet,"I'd say you have to make a decision:

Option 1: pack that up and think of it like your childhood trophy box - a phase of life that happened, you enjoyed, you had some amazing memories made from OR....

Option 2: This is something you aren't willing to live without, that absolutely will be a deciding factor going forward and you're willing to make tradeoffs of time or other things in order to have something similarly amazing in the future.

The biggest thing is to make a choice to do ONE or the OTHER. 

If you bury it, bury it and be done with it. Close the door firmly and lock it. Don't be that jackass slipping into onlyfans and going to places to scratch that itch every time you travel for business, hiring escorts, etc.

n8f17kd,1movfbr,AskMen,AutoModerator,"Here's an original copy of /u/DetectiveInformal214's post (if available):

Hi Brothers,

I have a few questions to ask and share.

I’m not officially diagnosed, but I’m aware that I have CPTSD, and I’ve been working on it since last year. I’ve learned a lot about myself, like what gives me anxiety, and I’ve developed some skills and priorities in my life.

Recently, I discovered that there’s no defined masculinity, and that everyone has their own version, coming from their heart. I want to explore that area too and become a person who is happy and peaceful.

An idea I got from a man is to reflect on what I like in superheroes and write about them.

For example: I like the scene between Batman and Heath Ledger's Joker in the jail, where Joker has people who are close to Batman, and Batman can’t harm him. But in that scene, Joker behaves as if it affects him.

Another example: Thanos and Gamora, when Thanos pushes Gamora off the mountain and says, “My purpose or plan is more important.” Gamora is his daughter, but he didn’t let her stop him.

I don’t know whether I’m doing this right or wrong, but I’m open to advice and suggestions. How do I explore both my masculinity and femininity? I believe every human has both, so if I explore one, the other will naturally follow.

Sometimes I do things I like, but I don’t always feel happy. I wonder if other people feel happy when they do what they want to do. Please guide me.

I’m happy to answer any questions if you have them. Thank you!

n8fa2bv,1movfbr,AskMen,Homely_Bonfire,">How do I explore both my masculinity and femininity? I believe every human has both, so if I explore one, the other will naturally follow.

The definitions I grew up with were quite simple, although a bit mouthy:

Masculinity is the sum of traits and behavior resulting from genetics and hormones that are unique to, especially pronounced in or most commonly found amongst members of the species who were born with the organs that would produce the smaller reproductive cells.

This leads to a couple conclusions:

* Anyone can display these traits and behaviors
* Fertility is not a ""mandatory"" factor
* Someone trans can adopt more traits and behaviors from the desired gender to align more with it
* There are some traits that are a result of long term hormonal exposure (e.g. higher bone and muscles density after growing up with lots of testosterone or on average broader shoulders and the likelihood of growing a beard)

>I like the scene between Batman and Heath Ledger's Joker in the jail, where Joker has people who are close to Batman, and Batman can’t harm him. But in that scene, Joker behaves as if it affects him.

I'll honestly say, imaginary people of which one is a mentally unstable murderer are probably not the go to examples to go from. Additionally I personally do not see much to do with masculinity or feminity in the scene you discribe, a protector instinct exists with both as social bonds are the essential driver of all social creatures (even social animals moarn and can be threatend through harm of another, although to a different degree).

>Sometimes I do things I like, but I don’t always feel happy.

That's normal. Happiness never was a ""constant state"" someone is in. That is why basically all religions preach some sort of paradise where permanent happiness can be gained. Happiness seems more like a temporary state of delight you will suddenly feel when you discover that your current actions, results and feedback from those actions indicate to you that you are in synch with reality. You goals are in sights, you got indicators and first rewards for doing things that bring you closer to your goals. But most people find out that happiness doesn't last once you reach the goal. Most prominently proven with lottery winners. It's rush, a high that tapers of independent of whether they waste the money or not. The high is ""happiness"" and if they don't fall back down to the same level as before but stay a bit elevated, thats content - and aiming for that can already do a lot for people. 

>I wonder if other people feel happy when they do what they want to do.

Sure the question is whether thats always a good thing. You can feel happy by going out getting drunk, do drugs and sleep with a lovely stranger... but you might feel worse the day after. Maybe you don't and do it again the next day. Some do this for a few years but at some point the artificial happiness of indulgence wears off... and depending on how long your brain was flooded with deceptive chemicals of happiness the normal, the reality may become unbearable. 

\---------------

In the end these are two different questions: 

Masculinity and feminity IMO have no business being these overblown glorified pseudo religious ""super states"" one has to achieve, they are rather unspectecular, descriptive terms.

Happiness VS content is a more complex question from my experience, since you seem interested in movies, you may like to look for George Lucas's lecture on that as he dissects it in the context of what fuels the story of Star Wars.",1,2025-08-12 23:19:05,False,How Can I Explore and Define My Own Masculinity?,0,2025-08-12 21:59:43,5,,,,,,[]

A man who has never been in a relationship cannot relate or meaningfully engage with another human being who has done those things, even if he reads about them it will be like a adventure book reader trying to meaningfully talk to a mountaineer.

And with age the gap keeps growing.

God forbid you had any sort of life event happen, or dont live up to what they built up in their head. The same goes with friendships as you get older. The hard truth is that women make friends easier because they gossip and talk more. Men have more acquaintances as they get older, simply because they don't talk as much.

I'll preface this by saying that my personal online dating experience is limited to the late 90s with Yahoo Personals and Match.com so I've never actually done app dating or modern online dating. And I only got maybe 3 or 4 dates and a few hookups on those sites before I met my wife. But from everything I've seen on social media regarding modern online dating it looks like it's something that can't possibly last. Now I'm not sure what the future for dating might be but it can't be sitting around your house and ordering up a life partner with the same effort you put into ordering food to be delivered to your home. Pretty much 90% of dating horror stories I read on Reddit would be completely mitigated by meeting someone in real life before you agree to meet up for a date. Because without that initial face-to-face interaction you can only vet people based on the scant information provided by them on the app. Basically, how do you know if the person you agree to go out with is a mouth breathing lunatic without that initial face-to-face?

n8bnhwg,1mo9at0,AskMen,JimCap5,"I have a bunch:

1) Most men are totally okay with waiting to have sex.  We're totally okay with taking it slow when it comes to intimacy, but we feel pressure on dates to make moves because we're terrified of being friendzoned.  I got rejected 100 percent of time if I didn't kiss her at the end of the 2nd date by the latest. It's like **I HAVE** to skillfully escalate to keep her interested.  I'm not saying shove your tongue down her throat the first 15 minutes of meeting her, but at the same time you don't want to blow through 3 dates being a platonic chit chat buddy either.  There's a skill to this.

2) If a woman isn't attracted to you, she'll topic shift a lot to prevent a connection.  I remember on one date this woman talked about how she is getting into snowboarding.  I know *a lot* about snowboarding and was very familar with the place she was getting lessons at.  Instead of having a good convo about it, she topic shifted to something random.  I could tell that girl wasn't into me.

3) If you live at home with parents, it'll nuke your dating life.  It deeply turns women off even if you're saving up for a down payment on a house / working a full time job / whatever.  They simply don't like it.  This is the biggest double standard in dating: a woman can live at home with her mom to save money and no ones cares.  But if a guy is that situation, he's an undateable loser.

4) Fat women get hit up for sex a lot, but struggle to get into a real relationship.  In other words a lot of men enjoy having sex with fat chicks, but are socially embarrassed by it.

5) More healthy realtionships would form if women gave a guy more of a chance instead of leaving over superficial deal breakers.  I'm willing to bet good money that a lot of women who rejected me on the 1st date would have really started liking me as they got to know me better.  Modern dating doesn't give a guy much time to let his meaningful qualities show.

6) Dating starts feeling disenguous after awhile.  Same date spots, same photos I show on my phone, same timing and so on.  It feels like I'm running through the same 3 levels of a video over and over.  You just start noticing patterns and realizing some things lead to progression and other things don't.  It's like like working in sales I guess.

7) Most people ghost not because of safety, but becasue they don't want to have a difficult conversation.

8) Meeting women outside of apps is actually really hard.  Most people keep to themselves nowadays.",4,2025-08-12 10:35:04,False,What are your online dating hot takes or unpopular opinions?,14,2025-08-12 06:51:00,160,,,,,,[]

n8dspo3,1mo9at0,AskMen,fffangold,"This is a super common opinion on Reddit.

And I think it's conspiracy theory nonsense (mostly).

Yes, the apps want you to stick around to make money. But they don't do anything to prevent people from matching with each other. How they make their money is obvious. They prey on monkey brain wanting immediate gratification. 

""Oh look, you have likes, pay to see who they are!"" 

""Not getting any likes? Pay us money and we'll show you to more people!""

Stuff like the above? Yeah, absolutely. And it's mostly smoke and mirrors. You can just swipe on people and match without seeing who likes you. In fact, most apps move people who like you close to the front of your list as long as they aren't excluded by your filters. And if you aren't getting any likes, being shown to more people probably won't help... it'll just be more people swiping left on you because you still need to fix your profile in some way. And if you are getting likes, you probably don't need more faster, they'll keep coming.  And you can check out the people who you're interested in first, then wait for more.

What they aren't doing is preventing women (or men) from liking you to keep you in a hole and single. By their basic function they can't do that. Speaking from a man's perspective, if a woman thinks I'm cute/likes my bio/whatever she uses to swipe right, then she's going to swipe right on me. And if I think she's a good match, I'll swipe right on her. Presto magico, I have a match. Then we chat, and it either fizzles or we decide to meet, amd then it fizzles or we get together. The app has no control once we start talking.

Now, does swiping make it harder to match and get the conversation started compared to ye olden times where you could just send a cute lady you liked a message and she could just respond, no swiping required? Yeah, for sure. But for reasons I'll never understand, a majority of people seem to prefer swiping over the old school style.

The point is, there is no conspiracy to keep people single. There's just too many people out there, and it's hard to find one who is right for you and also interested in you.",2,2025-08-12 17:05:09,False,What are your online dating hot takes or unpopular opinions?,14,2025-08-12 06:51:00,160,,,,,,[]

Not really. Realistically, there aren't ways to make up for it for the majority of us who are in that predicament. 

> I think this understanding leads a lot of guys to give up entirely, but it happens so young. I've talked to guys who are barely 20 who act like they're already in the death spiral

That's fair. I wouldn't start considering giving up until I start finding myself on the wrong side of 20. I'm already coming up on 31 and it's fairly obvious to me that I'm going to die alone.

> but giving up is the only way to actually lose

Giving up is sometimes the best and most pragmatic option after a certain point.

> The other problem I see is that they often have a desperation to ""catch up"".

Yes, and for good reason

> But some aspects of social development just can't be rushed. You don't go from the couch to running a marathon. It's okay to take the smaller steps and to at your own pace.

Uhhh, no. Just no

There comes a particular age and a certain point in life where you being behind just becomes a massive, glaring red flag. 

If you've ever repeated a grade then you'll know how behind you feel compared to the other kids your age who have gone on to progress. You're playing catch up. If you're lucky and play your cards right, you MAY have a shot at catching up a bit. But the fact of the matter is, you will always be at least one step behind. 

But there comes a point where all hope is truly lost. It's harmful and misleading to pretend otherwise. 

> I also suspect a lot of those guys are autistic. Doesn't hurt to get tested and diagnosed so you can at least understand yourself and your issues better.

Be fully present in conversations and with people; let them see you care about what they say and try to formulate thoughtful responses. 

Bring a bit of life to your world and interactions. Speak more eloquently, try layering tone and cadence a little more. 

Make it about them by asking interesting questions that people don’t usually ask and then be interested in the response. 

At the end of the day, charisma isn’t about how interesting you are. it’s about how people feel about themselves after being around you.

n8bs1u9,1moe5qm,AskMen,Key-Proud,"Charisma is providing value and not asking for anything in return.
- just asking for nothing in return is enough because everyone is always have hidden agenda and asking for something from people.

For example, the difference between a bad comedian vs is a good comedian is the bad comedian is reaction seeking.  They say a funny joke, then waits for the crowds reaction ... if the crowd laughs then the comedian feels good ... if the crowd doesnt laugh ... the comedian feels bad.
- I good comedian says a joke that is funny to them, they giggle at the thought of the joke, and then delivers the joke.  They dont care if others find it funny or not.  

So why does the good comedian have charisma?
- first their is a thing called mirror neurons we humans have.  It helps us sense how others are feeling.  For example we feel sadness when we see someone crying.  The crowds uses their mirror neurons to sense that the good comedian is giggling inside when delivering the joke. They sense this and they also feel the giggles.... you can even share this feeling without saying a word!  Also, since he doesnt care whether find his joke funny or not ... this shows they are not asking for anything in return when sharing their good feelings with everyone!

- now what does the crowd feels off the bad comedian?  They sense neediness because the comedians defines their own good mood whether the crowd laughs at their joke or not.  This is how awkward moments happen.  When you put someone on a pedastal so you treat them more special than others.  The bad comedians mood is dependent on others.

So there is away to train this ... guess how?",1,2025-08-12 10:57:14,False,How to build charisma?,9,2025-08-12 09:54:42,29,,,,,,[]

n89yoes,1mo2igb,AskMen,MajIssuesCaptObvious,"Not quite. I had relationships, and they tried to be there for me on occasion, but for the most part, they made my life harder. In some relationships, we each had shit going on, so venting to each other came off as complaining, and neither wanted to listen. Mostly, they were emotionally needy or were just interested in their fun, and added to my burden. Or they just changed the subject and temporarily distracted me, but I still had to deal with the problems alone. Through it all, I kept working at it, making good decisions, and finally reached success on my own in my 40s, and it's been the best decade of my life.

I heard that ""women wait at the finish line."" I'd like to believe that's not true, but it sure does feel that way. I don't think all women do that, but I do think it's most, based on my experience.

n8caei6,1mo2igb,AskMen,perpulstuph,"We've been together 10 years this year, married 4 of them this month.

When she met me, honestly, I had nothing going for me.  I was 25,worked part time at an amusement, was going to school part time trying to figure out what I even wanted to do, living with my mom and two brothers. My life mostly revolved around school and videogames.  I didn't even have a car.  I was also finally and slowly coming out of nearly a decade long depression wherein suicidal ideation was a constant companion.  She saw something about me, and was almost instantly in love.  Our relationship grew.  Instead of judgement (okay, a little judgement) she mostly tried to find out what I wanted in life.  What were my dreams and aspirations, what went wrong to leave me stuck living the exact same life I lived right after I graduated high school.

I knew I wanted her in my life, I was motivated to do whatever it was to keep her in my life.  She almost constantly made me think about what I wanted for myself, and what can I do to make that happen.  I finished my nursing degree at 31, her helping me see what I truly wanted in life helped me push myself forward, with her constant support, and I now have a beautiful wife and two beautiful kids.  My depression has gone away.

Pro-tip to the men: when shit starts going sideways in your life, an invisible countdown starts in your woman’s brain.  If that countdown hits zero before you’ve fixed whatever it is, don’t be surprised if she bails.

Losing my best friend, who i had known all my life and hung out with pretty much every week for the last 15 years of his life was the hardest thing I've ever dealt with and nearly 4 years on I'm still not over it in the least bit. 

It never even occurred to me to reach out to my wife about any of this. I'm in my 50s and as a Gen X'er I think my generation is the last one to have the old timey beliefs that men don't share their problems with anyone. The thing is, even if I wanted to I wouldn't know how. And as wonderful a person as my wife is she wouldn't really know how to handle it if I did. Neither of us were taught how this works. I never saw my dad do it and my wife never saw her mom comfort her father. But I will say, after what happened to my buddy, I'm trying to teach my son that it's okay to talk to your pals about things that are bothering you. Because I realized that even though we had been friends for over 40 years I don't think my buddy and I ever had a conversation about our feelings or problems. I think that's more of an issue than unloading on your wife or girlfriend. I think it would be better, and healthier, if men talked to each other about this stuff.

n895xdp,1mo2igb,AskMen,BoerInDieWoestyn,">did you appreciate her while the low was happening? Did the appreciation come later?

Definitely not at the time no. I was angry all the time, I felt like everyone hated me for no reason (they did hate me, but with good reason), and if I didn't get my way I could ruin the whole day for everyone. I took her being around to calm me down for granted because ""what do you mean I'm not the best person in the world?""

>And did she ever let on how it was for her during the tough times or did she try and hold that back to focus on you?

She told me how horrible I was all the time. We would have massive fights about my drinking and the way I treated her every second night. Then when we both ran out of steam to fight I would go sulk somewhere and she would take some time to compose herself and then come try cam me down. Sometimes it worked and we'd talk a little like normal people. Sometimes I was so consumed by my own emotions that I would start up the fight again. Even now, more than two years later we talk about it and my defenses naturally go up when she starts talking about her experience of things. I am much better at listening and accepting now than I was back then, but my knee jerk reaction is to reject what she's saying. But that's the addict brain talking, and over time I've gotten better at putting those feelings aside so I can listen to her.

I'm not perfect, and I'm still trying to make up for what I did, but now at least I am not trying to only protect myself.

n8f0b0p,1mo2igb,AskMen,BoerInDieWoestyn,"I don't want to get your hopes up, addiction is a nasty thing and many people lose everything before they get help. Some don't even get help at that point.

The best thing you can do is to be there for them and remind them that there is a better life. Try to get them in the door with AA/NA or another sobriety group because they'll feel understood that way. I don't know if you've ever had a problem with drugs or alcohol but I only felt truly understood when I walked into a room full of people that were like me. Try to have these conversations when they're sober, because when they're drunk or high you're basically talking to a different person. And lastly, have a plan to cut your losses and leave. I'm not saying you should leave or you should stay, I don't know what your situation is like, but don't expect to be able to change them or that they'll get sober after you said some magic words. I'm not saying this to discourage you, I'm just trying to keep things realistic. Addiction is a hard thing to deal with.

If you want help for yourself as the partner of an addict there are groups like Al-Anon that you can go to.

As for making up for it, I have put in a lot of work to rebuild everything I tore down. I took a job working overseas that pays more money so that we could thrive instead of simply surviving. I have gone to therapy and I'm going to start it up again soon once I'm settled in my new working location. One thing that really hurt her while I was drinking was how I lied about anything and everything. It's easier to tell the truth when you're sober because there's simply less you need to lie about, but when you spent the majority of your life lying to everyone you need to do a lot of work to unlearn it. I still catch myself lying about stuff because I'm scared of what her reaction to the truth might be.

n8ashfu,1mo1cla,AskMen,Patopml,"My last one for sure. Happened almost 2 years ago. Together 4. I never loved anyone the way I loved her. She was my partner and my best friend.

Our relationship had some logistic issues which impacted our dynamics, I guess even from early on, as we lived in different countries/continents, however due to pandemic and remote work we managed to be together most of the time. But finally managing to live together in the same country was very time and energy consuming.

Anyway, long story short, first two years amazing, full of love, trips, laughter, plans, projects. Third one things got more complicated. Final one, painful. Fights, distance, she was studying a very demanding course so we spent little time together, she made more friends, went out more... you get the idea... I was also very unhappy in general living in London, feeling lonely and isolated, and constantly hating the gray and rainy weather. And in all fairness, I made my mistakes as well during the relationship, although never intentional or to hurt her. I always tried to talk, improve, be better.

One day after we went on holidays in separate ways, we came back, and within a day she decided to end things. I was absolutely heartbroken, but accepted what she wanted. I wanted to work on us, but within a week it was clear that it was over.

Now, remember the course and nights out I mentioned? Within maybe 3/4 weeks I saw stories with her instructor. Removed her from all social media. Within a couple of months, through friends I learned that she was apparently dating him. Within a year, again, through friends, I learned that she is engaged and will get married to that guy. Exactly the guy I had my suspicions on. Talk about gut instinct, huh?

Throughout this process I can tell you that my heart was not shattered, it was absolutely blasted. She always made me believe that these people were ""just friends"", and even made me feel that I was being controlling (I'm the least controlling guy in the world), and that she needed more space.

After the breakup and for the first maybe 2/3 months I've cried like I never cried in my life. The pain was unbearable at times, like an arm or something being ripped from me. It got a little bit better after, but not massively. First year was hard. Then it was much better, and continues to be.

You know, if I could talk to the girl I knew, the girl I dated, the one I fell in love with, the one who loved me, the one with whom we had our world of jokes, love, projects, and that I thought could work on anything, I'd just ask her... ""do you know what you did to me? are you aware of how much you hurt me? Relationships end, I get it, but never ever looking back? just going with someone else? really?""... But she just doesn't exist anymore anyway.

Today, I've moved countries, did a lot of reflecting, I'm a lot stronger, know myself a lot better (learned a shit ton of things really), I'm dating again, and I'm happier than I was in London. Hoping to start a family at some point. Sometimes it still hurts though, I must admit. These things leave scars, and only time can heal them.

Sometimes it's hard to build a consistent narrative of what the hell happened, specially when things are messy and you can't put your finger on a single thing. Was it all the dynamics? was it cheating? was she using me? did she ever really love me?

These are some of the questions that linger for a while and they may go unanswered forever. Its crucial to reflect and learn, but also to accept that they may just remain unanswered. This causes a bit of pain too, which is why a narrative is necessary (not a delusional one, but a possible and realistic one), where you can allocate roles and responsibilities and then close it forever.

I was actually the dumper. Great sense of humor, shared some similar hobbies, both liked the same movies, same music, and had some really fun times.  I really did love her deeply. Plus her parents were great. I would sometimes go over to just hangout with her dad. 


Thing is she had issues. Controlling, trust issues, and wanted me all to herself. I couldnt have a social life. Even if I made plans with friends in advance and she seemed ok with it, the day of plans she'd start a fight before I left or fight with me through text the whole time.


She would sometimes even start fights with me I swear was out of boredom too. Trying to pressure me into having kids before we were a year in. 


I ended up pulling the plug a year and a half in. The constant fights and my mental health couldnt take it.  I felt absolutely horrible. I had to end up blocking her because she kept calling me for 2 weeks after crying .  That made me feel like a horrible  person. I hope she got help and is doing well.

One day during the  summer of graduation we hungout all day up until late at night and we ended up making out. I was so happy because I thought we were going to date.

One of my co-workers, we'll call her.... Muriel, used to whistle. Tunelessly, and non-stop.

All.

Day.

Long.

Every,

Day.

She was approached on numerous occasions, and asked politely to either stop whistling or whistle an actual song. All she did was TOOT....TOOT..TOOT.....TOOT..............TOOT...TOOT......TOOT.

She, refused.

She had a small, stuffed teddy bear on her desk.

So.... one day, person or persons unknown, took her little teddy bear, blindfolded it with electric tape, held a (plastic, cap) gun to it's head, and took a polaroid of it.

The polaroid was then left on her desk with a note reading, ""The whistling stops or the bear gets it.""

Much drama ensued when she went to management over it, and corporate security got involved. The whistling didn't stop, and the bear was never seen again.

n8es21h,1mosjll,AskMen,LuckyCod2887,"I had an office job where the secretary would never stop talking.

so what happened at my office might be going on in your office. there might be a few people encouraging her to talk a lot.

I worked at a domestic violence shelter, I worked on the admin side, so they were like therapists and social workers and stuff in the office. The social workers and the therapist would go up to the front desk and chat up with the secretary. If a client missed their session, the therapist or the social worker would sit there for literally a solid hour just gabbing away.  unbelievable especially since I became a caseworker after leaving that job and I couldn’t imagine using an hour to fuck around. 

this behavior from other coworkers reinforced the social activity from the secretary.

I kept my head down and don’t make chitchat with her because I always try to keep it professional and friendly in the workplace no matter how tempting it is and how badly I want friendship I just don’t do it. (unless it’s a working class job. There’s like almost no rules at a working class job.)  and in my personal opinion if someone is talking a lot, they’re gonna gossip and start drama and instigate dog shit and bullshit and get everybody worked up and do all this crazy nonsense etc 

so I think the only thing you can do is just be a little bit firm, have reduced facial expressions, stay polite, intentionally be boring, and don’t get too physically close to them. yes, they will eventually gossip about you because you’re not talking to them, but there’s not gonna be very much they can discuss because you’re literally not giving them any ammo.

This shocked me because I’ve had those fantasies too, but I always thought they came from a place of low self-worth.

n8crr9n,1mohabc,AskMen,Phaustiantheodicy,"I really don't know what defines hook up culture. People will say that it only counts if your at a bar or party and hooked up, others think having sex on the first date counts as a hook up. 

I'd honestly say I'm fine with it. But I'm a guy. I was listening to a podcast about hook-up culture from a female psychologist point of view. 

In all honesty, girls don't want to hook up with guys. They want relationships, but they are super insecure and hook up with the wrong dudes. 

Guys love hook up culture, because its meant to satisfy the male urge for self-grarification. 

I went on first dates and hooked up with girls on them. I don't count that as hook up culture. I also don't really think people even know what they mean by hook up culture. 

Like whats the opposite of hook up culture? Waiting til marriage? Or till your boyfriend and girlfriend? I honestly don't know, but I'd say women are 100% screwed on this tbh. 

Male enrollment in college has dropped, and women enrollment is rising. If there are now guys in a college then women, then women have to adjust to male expectations for dating. Most men want easy access to sex. Women aren't going to date men if they don't feel like they are equals, hence they probably won't date non-college educated guys. So “hook-up culture” is here to stay.",2,2025-08-12 13:47:12,False,"Men who participate in hookup culture, what are your feelings on it?",5,2025-08-12 11:47:57,71,,,,,,[]

I took a class, which heavily disscuessed the problems of trans people. One of the case study was a person who started off as a girl, became a guy, and I think went back to being a women? Or only dated women as a women. I can't remember. 

She said that guys want sex because there aggressive urge to just have sex, as a guy I can agree, and that once that urges is over then talk of a relationship is easier. They said its really hard to discuss a possible relationship when you sex is the only thing on your mind.

I drink a lot of coffee and tea, all day long for work and taste. And I think it’s hurting my sleep badly. So I’m going to grind it and quit caffeine and suffer a bit with withdrawal with the hope that my sleep will greatly improve afterwards. 

Anyone give up caffeine for the main or significant purpose to improve their sleep (getting to sleep, staying asleep and better sleep quality)? How did it go?

The swiss water decaf was passable, has basically no caffeine. I did that about 9 months before I was like, this is just shit. I felt like shit all the time and eventually went to basic decaf which has _some_ but not much caffeine. That tasted better at least.

n8d49vo,1mokppv,AskMen,ClearLocation7289,"Learn how to do basic house mainteance. I know a girl who called an electrician to have a lightbulb changed. He made her pay 50 for coming there (a bit high, but standard where I live), 10 for the new lightbulb (a scam) and 30 for the work (another scam, obviously). My father spends 4k yearly in gardeners. It's not much for him, but I could do it for free if lived nearby. It saves so much money.

I like it and it makes me feel manly, but if you really don't just have ChatGPT help you. On a side note, electricians are often needed for safety concerns, but most of the plumbing (stress on the most) can be done by yourself. I changed the filter of my boiler a month ago. The filter costed around 40 euros and it took my 6 hours, including understanding the problem and the fact that it needed to be changed. My landlady insisted to call a plumber to have it checked and he confidently told me he would have asked 250 for the work+call. To put it into perspective, I saved 210 euros by working 6 hours and now I learned how to do it for next time.

I had a collegue complain in the office that he had to change the battery of his car and the mechanic asked a (I don't remember the number) high price. I told him I'd do it with him on the parking lot below, in 1 hour we where done and he payed for my lunch (2.50, but it's nice he did that). The battery itself was a bit expensive, but he saved a lot. We had no idea how to do it and simply read the car manual and watched a youtube video. It was very easy and, honestly, fun.

n8as2iw,1moaju4,AskMen,ProbablyLongComment,"I don't know what CASA is.

If you're referring to the Big Brothers/Big Sisters organization, my brief experience was overwhelmingly positive where the kids (little brothers) were concerned.  Most children in the program do not have a father or male role model in their lives, and they are *hungry* for male support.

In my two visits, I taught a group of about 20 boys how to tie a tie, how to respectfully introduce themselves, and how to use a screwdriver and a hammer.  I had to pick these topics, and honestly, I felt like I was phoning it in.  I thought they would surely be bored, and would want to talk video games, YouTube, etc.

They were *fascinated.*  I brought three ties, and after several rounds of tying them, at the kids' request, I decided to let the kids keep the ties, by drawing names from a bowl.  All three winners begged to wear the ties home--with their T-shirts and jeans--and couldn't wait to show their moms what they learned.  Each one ""introduced"" themselves to their mothers as we had practiced, which mostly involved a handshake, eye contact, and, ""Nice to meet you.""

Tool day was an even bigger success.  Very much the same format; I demonstrated, kids practiced, and a bunch of kids went home with cheap Harbor Freight screwdrivers and hammers.  Fully two thirds of the kids swore to build big houses for their moms.  Adorable.

My wife was a Big Sister, and had similar success with the girls.  She also taught some very basic manners and dress skills, and her second visit also involved how to talk to people politely.  She also taught conflict resolution, and how to set healthy boundaries when being approached by strangers.

Unfortunately, the organization itself wasn't great.  I don't know if this only pertains to our specific branch, but the organizers were fundamentalist Christians.  Despite the kids' enjoyment and enthusiasm, and the organizers' initial praise of our volunteering efforts, we were asked not to return once one of the youth ministers discovered we were not religious.  For context, we simply stepped to the back of the room during group prayer time; we at no point discussed any religious topics with the kids, nor the organizers.

The organizers had the gall to mention that they were desperately short on volunteers.  Immediately after asking us to not come back, they asked if we knew any *Christian* adults who might volunteer.  We did not, we calmly told them so, and we got a disapproving ""Mmm-*hmm*"" in return.  We waved goodbye to the kids (who did not know we weren't returning), and the head organizer *warned the kids not to talk to us,* in front of us, on our way out.",3,2025-08-12 08:00:16,False,Has anyone been a big brother or CASA?

n8ayibp,1moaju4,AskMen,RusskieRed,"I'm an active CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocate) in Oregon and have had one case for about six months now. 

I enjoy it and think it's a really good program overall. Super rewarding building rapport with the kid(s) and being put in a position to potentially make big, tangible differences in their life. 

First off (at least in Oregon), you aren't even allowed to talk to the parents without their lawyer's OK. They (as well as resource/foster parents) are motivated to be on their best behavior around you, since you are effectively a representative of the court. Even in shittier cases, your job is not to get into conflicts with anyone - just check out the home, how the kid's doing, what the people around them are saying and document it for the court. Unless you are extremely conflict-averse, I wouldn't let this be the thing that pushes you away from this work. 

All that said, you should check in with yourself to see what you're emotionally prepared to put up with - the goal for DHS is almost ALWAYS going to be reunification with the parents (with solid, data-driven reasons for doing so), but I think most people don't spend much time thinking about what the state qualifies as a ""minimum standard of care"". It's probably much much lower than you expect, and you need to be okay with the idea that even in some pretty rough circumstances, the kid is probably going back to that home.

I would strongly recommend joining an info session (Oregon has regular info Zoom sessions for anyone considering applying) and just see what those folks have to say. It's absolutely not for everyone, but it is super rewarding work at a time when these kids really need someone to listen to and support them.

 I think spending that amount of time in extreme peril just rewired my nervous system.

The PTSD was not very fun. It's been 4 years now, and it is better, but I still get a dreadful jolt if I see an image or read something too close to my experience. I do not enjoy hospitals, doctors, the smell of antiseptic and especially medical imaging. 

I am basically made of toxic masculinity, so it wasn't easy to admit I was hurting, and it was even harder to admit I needed help. Talk therapy made it worse. Sharing with other damaged people made it worse. Trying to make people who hadn't experienced something like this was futile, making them uncomfortable, and me feel even more isolated.

EMDR helped. A lot. I was very sceptical, and I still dont entirely understand how it helped, but it really did.

I have got quite severe social anxiety, and the one thing I have been told maybe 3 times now was that some people in the past were flirting with me, and I never once picked up on it.

There are now 2 girls that I am friends with, and one of them in particular has been doing certain things, but I have no clue if they are flirting with me or not, and I don't know what to do if she is and I don't want to do something to then find out she isn't. This is my anxiety taking over now. Our age gap is big though, 18 years old.

There is also another girl (25) who is an acquaintance, but I have never spoken to her. The other day, she spoke to me and her second question ever was ""how old are you"".

What am I, being the man AKA ""dominant"" and ""initiator"", supposed to do? Anyone give any advice?

Also, I know nothing dirty. When people say dirty things to me, I don't understand it. I've never seen a body or even had a gf. Very innocent as they may say.

n8f92rv,1mowab1,AskMen,orlybatman,"A well put together outfit that is flattering will work regardless of the color.

One of my female friends (blonde) has pairs of jeans in pastel blue and pastel pink. They always stood out to me because they're uncommon.

Another friend of mine (blonde again) often wears white silky blouses with high waist black pants that flare on the bottom. I know that's quite specific, but she's worn it a lot. She's playing with extreme contrast.

The woman I'm currently seeing (black hair with grey) likes wearing darker colors (like a deep purple dress) or darker earth tones. I've actually never seen her in light clothing, and she often wears outfits the same color for top and bottom. Though her styles are darker, she's quite fashion-minded and everything goes well together.

So in short, there's no specific color, but ones that stand out either from contrast, from being uncommon, or having a cohesive overall color scheme are all viable.

>Also, do you think redheads who wear red look good or bad?? (W fair skin)

It can work but I would personally like the contrast of green better. They're complementary colors so her hair would stand out more.

n86h9i1,1mnpek5,AskMen,AutoModerator,"Here's an original copy of /u/JimCap5's post (if available):

For me it was losing my job.  I was a high school teacher and my contract wasn't renewed.  I'm currently unemployed waiting to hear back from a district to sub in.  I've been unemployed for 3 months, and this is exactly what happened to me:

1) I lost some dignity and some of my identity.  I went from being a proud teacher with a career to an unemployed bum.

2) I'm stressed about money.  Now that I have no income, I'm very aware of how expensive everything is.

3) I lost my health insurance since it was tied to my employer which means I'm not able to see my therapist anymore even though ironically I need to see him more than ever.

4) Updating my resume and spamming my resume is soul crushing.  It's a lot like dating, sometimes you meet someone quickly and other times it's been 3 months an my ass is still unemployed.

5) People lose respect for you.  My girlfriend of two years broke up with me.  Our relationship had a lot of problems, but I know she was looking at me with ick while I was unemployed.  It deeply turns people off.

6) I may have a job lined up in a different city which will require me to relocate uprooting my life.

7) I feel bitter about being let go.  When I think back at my old boss / superiors, I don't feel anything good.

I can keep going on and on, but I'm surprised how much trauma this whole thing has caused me.  Not looking for advice, but I thought the predicament is rather interesting with my world getting shook to its core.

Wasn’t too far into marriage, having kids, just bought a house.. everything was flippin butterflies and rainbows…. And well SHHHHIIIITTTT!. 60 days later.. I’m trying to find anything.  Absolutely nothing in aircraft…. The only thing I really knew. I felt like what you do now.    

I went and helped my in-laws on the farm and kept looking.  Eventually found a job and got back on track. 

My point.  You will find something, you aren’t worthless, when you do find a job-job you will look back fondly on the time you had being unemployed and wish you had done some more fun things you wont get to do again until you are retired.   

Seriously, take three weeks and a tent and go explore the country wherever you are.  Clear your mind, (keep posting for jobs though), and just eat baloney sandwiches and water.  Go see some things and think.  I absolutely promise that with a piece of paper in hand (degree), in teaching of all things.  YOU WILL FIND A JOB!  Teachers are in demand everywhere.  Sure you may have to move but just do it, life is completely open to you right now. You can go anywhere. You have nobody else to think about but you.  If you are US. Hell, Grab a bag and explore the Midwest.  Cheap living. Go to Nebraska, they need teachers.  The Colorado steps.  Need teachers. 

Now…. Back to your post title.  “What’s something surprisingly traumatic?”

1. The day after getting married.
2. The birth of your child.  HOLY SHIT!
3. Your 40 yr checkup when you take the prostate finger up the butt exam.
4. Your 50 yr old colonoscopy exam. 
5. Coming to grips with the fact your perfect little angel is banging some dude. 
6. Watching your parents die. 
7. I’m waiting for the next shit show… I’ll edit when it happens. 

Life is an exciting thing filled with trauma and joy.  What you have is a mere bump in the road that will give you experience for the next high and the next low.  It does in fact get easier friend.  The challenges don’t, but your ability to deal with them sure does.

n88eor8,1mnpek5,AskMen,BlessdRTheFreaks,"Man I've been fired a bunch of times, and I have such a different view of it. For me, the project of my life and who I am is totally separate from what I do for money. I think about how many people become trapped in their work identity, especially in America where work is the central aim of life. I think existential crises are about that -- about asking who you are when the ready made label falls off of you, it's time to introspect and systematically reorient yourself toward what you really want. I'm reminded of the astronauts who came back from the moon and space, what seeing earth against the backdrop of the void did to them emotionally and spiritually. All driven people, when they came back, many of them did what they always wanted to do, becoming artists, musicians, and writers. 

I think on the opposite end, as a guy whose made most of his money from construction, how people become an oxe trapped in the yoke of identity -- how many carpenters collapsed from heatstroke and then immediately got back up and kept working because without the work they don't know who they are. 

I'm glad my sky collapsed because it meant i got to put the stars back in exactly the way I wanted, after many years of deep questioning and consideration. And I bet a lot of the problems in your life really were coming from your perception and attitude -- people aren't as judgmental of you as you think if you're coming from a place of original energy, of someone who's thinking deep about what they really want from life and how they can get that in the way that's best for them.",2,2025-08-11 21:09:03,False,What's something that's surprisingly traumatic?,100,2025-08-11 14:13:52,53,,,,,,[]

n8911n6,1mnuj3k,AskMen,username_6916,"The basic answer is pretty simple: 

1. Know how much you're going to spend per year.

2. Multiply that by 33. (Assuming a 3% withdrawal rate: 1/3% = 33)

3. That's the portfolio you need to support yourself without dipping into the capital if you have it invested into a broadly diversified set of equities. 

That's the basic answer. It's arguably a bit conservative in some sense: You probably *could* spent a bit more in good years, so long as you're able to dial this back in bad years. It's arguably a big aggressive in some sense: A truly economically cataclysmic event early on may difficult to recover from if you *have* to draw the full 3% to survive. Spending flexibility helps your odds.

Then you determine how much money you need at your retirement target age to withdrawal between 3-4% of the total money per year to take a salary off of. 

Now $100,000 in todays dollar if you adjust for inflation 2-3% average right?

Future Value = 100,000 \times (1 + 0.03)^{30} = 
$242,700 

So in 30 years 242,700 will have about the same buying power as $100,000 today… 

Required Capital = Annual Withdrawal/ Withdrawal Rate

242,700/ 0.03= 8,090,000


So in 30 years, from now, to spend what would feel like $100,000 today… you’d need roughly $8mm to take out money at a 3% withdrawal rate… 

Now how do you get to that $8mm net worth? 

If you invested roughly 49k a year for the next 30 years, assuming the market returns 10% on average. You’d hit your $8mm goal…


You really don’t wanna burn through the savings. You want to live off the interest from the investments.

Yes this sounds high. And while you might need $100k a year to live today. You probably won’t need that much when your kids are grown and moved out, your home is paid off, and you have social security, pension, etc, coming in… 

A good strategy to get there? Simply max your 401k and IRA that’s just over 30k a year… now if your company matches 5% of your salary or something + profit sharing… and you do some investing on the side… you’re pretty close. 

Go play around with chat GPT and ask it questions relating to your current financial snapshot. How much u save, how much you’re investing, what you’re invested in, your income, debts, etc… 

And have it help u figure out a realistic number to get to…

My math isn’t perfect here. It’s probably a bit too high of a long term inflation expectation. The key is to play around with it and make a few different scenario analyses. And figure out what’s realistic, possible, and what you’ll stick to.

This is also all determinant on where you live and your lifestyle… high cost of living area? NJ, NYC, CA? 100k might not be enough if your property taxes are 10-20k a year for a small house.

I did very well and am currently enrolled and happy. I'd say that a lot of time went into this. I started stretching daily about half an hour and the rest I went back running. I had an injury the year prior which essentially meant I couldn't do any sport for a few months and it felt very depressing to go back, as I used to compare myself with how I was before the injury. I also slept half an hour more every night (this is accurate, as I track my sleep very precisely)

It's a bit hard to pinpoint exactly what changed, but I think this sums it up more or less.

n85s967,1mnjlae,AskMen,AntiFeministLib,"January 2024 I was going to get a divorce and leave my wife. There was so much wrong in the relationship that it was irretrievable. Then my business went really, really bad and took me a while to recover it. During that time my wife found out about the mistress and so I braced for impact.

I fully expected a ""You get out of our house now"". I was so prepared I had my exit plan worked out and everything ready to go.

In the end, it didn't happen. She decided to accept it.

In some ways this complicated things because I was expecting the full blow up, the moving out, the divorce, the lawyers. I was ready to go with it all, psyched up for it, ready. When it didn'y happen I was suprised and shocked. Kind of like when you go to sneeze and you can't quite sneeze ?

Whilst it may feel like a man's dream to have a wife, family and girlfriend / mistress it's anything but. I'd be happier in one single, monogamous relationship. On the other hand my mistress just got a divorce too. I saw first hand what that put her through and how tought it was. Even now there's non stop stress of him not paying the child support, messing around with the visitation access and a ton of other things. I'm not entirely sure, despite society telling me it's the right thing to do, that breaking up a child's home is actually the best answer to the problems in a marriage.

I think ultimately the half in / half out marriage works best, but it's the least bad decision of a bad bunch.

Wife has accepted the mistress, she even asks after her sometimes and says I must be looking forward to seeing her again.

I don’t consider flirting and get/give  ego boosts as cheating.  It’s entirely different getting turned on by seeing your wife getting hit on in the real world vs learning there are now married exes and suitors of past and present with constant whispers all in the palm of her hand.

I’m absolutely not trying to be mean but I will be very blunt. Showering, washing your clothes, and just basic hygiene go a long way in pretty much all social situations and you probably smell disgusting to people if you don’t wash yourself daily.  Even if you don’t shower for a day or two, people can absolutely tell and it’s not a good thing for you as they immediately start making assumptions about the type of person you are. 

People won’t comment on it to you unless they are really good friends looking out for you.  Sadly, they’ll definitely talk shit behind your back about it and any new people you meet will probably think you’re gross and do what they can to avoid having to smell you by avoiding you. 

Each day you should shower and put on deodorant. Not all clothes need to be washed after every wear, but your underwear and socks should be.  Depending on how much your sweat, pants and sometimes shirts can get a few wears before washing but it’s very likely that you and everything you own smells disgusting to most people.",10,2025-08-11 08:25:34,False,What socially unacceptable thing do you secretly do?,197,2025-08-11 07:25:50,345,,,,,,[]

So in my mid 20s, I was living in Buffalo NY, working as a barista, and lived about a 20 minute walk from the cafe.

I was drinking pretty heavily most evenings, and my guts were generally a mess. Long story short, after an opening shift from 5am to 11am and several espressos I was about 5 minutes into my 20 minute walk home when I realized I that I had to go, right fucking now, in a residential street, and making it back to the cafe or home would not be an option. So I ducked into some poor fucks hedge, and let it absolutely rip into their front garden, wiped with a sock, and jogged the rest of the way home.

n8bdljg,1mnefm7,AskMen,AgentOfCUI,">I think you just don't have an informed stance, period

That's fine man. As I said at the start, your opinion about my stances is completely meaningless to me. 

>I don't think the complexity has much to do with it.

People taking binary stances on complex issues always want to believe the complexity is negligible. 

>If you knew the first thing about the conflict, you'd know its a historical one that, regardless of your larger opinion, is based in the displacement of one people for another. Which has absolutely nothing to do with Bloods and Crips on account of the fact that neither of those groups claim to hold nation-states in a historical homeland dedicated to their ethnicity.

The parallel is that the bloods and crips claim to hold territory in a historically gang occupied land. Saying that either Israel or Palestine holds true divine claim to that land is equally as valid as saying the blood or the crips hold true divine claim to a block of LA. 

>Leftists do not align themselves with Hamas for obvious reasons. The reaction you see from the left is simply a cry for justice in defense of a persecuted people.

Nahhhh. I've seen plenty of lefties crying for death to Israel while hiding behind the claim that their desire for genocide is preceded and justified by Iraeli actions.

n84flg6,1mndlk9,AskMen,FatLeeAdama2,"Some of my most memorable conversations with my teenage friends were when we really talked about things. 

I remember jogging with our track star around the track before a track meet and we were having a serious conversation about dating and how he feels confident approaching women from other schools. 

He was trying to boost my confidence when I trip right over a starting block. We laughed our asses off…

n8432zq,1mndlk9,AskMen,Special_Bed604,"If I had to guess, you were raised by - thus conditioned by - mostly women.  Mom, grandma, aunts, sisters.  So, you were raised in that feminine mindset and that feminine energy.  That’s the method of communication you learned as a child, and as you were growing up, so you carry that through to adulthood.  So when you run across men, because they don’t show their empathy in the same way women do, or uplift and support you like women do, it feels like something’s missing from the equation.  Where’s the, “There, there.  It’ll be okay.”?  Where’s the, “Your feelings are valid, and I acknowledge them”?  Where’s the, “Oooh, that’s so bad!”?  Why are these guys telling you to suck it up, when all you really want is your feelings validated?  How is *that* helpful?

So, if I had to guess, instead of trying to figure out how men can have male friendships without that feminine behaviour of, as you say, uplifting you, supporting you emotionally, and listening to your rants with a sympathetic and empathetic ear, you’ve just decided men are emotionally dead inside, can’t give you what you’re looking for, and so go back to friendships with women, which is what you know and are familiar with.

That’s my diagnosis.  My guess is, you haven’t quite been able to figure out exactly why you should be friends with men, because they don’t uplift you, support you emotionally and listen to your rants.  Since you can’t quite figure out what male friendships offer - because it’s not of the above - and why it’s a benefit to you, you discard them as unnecessary or surplus to requirements.

And I have plenty of male friends, and have a great time hanging out with them, I just have a harder time connecting with them on a deeper level. Pretty common among men though I think. I studied abroad in college and was in a language class with only women in the program. I made it clear from the onset that I was in a committed relationship and loved my girlfriend (now wife) very much. So between me genuinely not having interest in trying to get in their pants (when people cheating on their SOs at home was rampant), along with everyone being out of their comfort zone being in foreign country with no one you know, was a recipe for close friendships to form. 

Two of the women in that class became my closest friends over that semester and we have remained close friends when we moved back home for the past 10 years. They were always completely respectful of my relationship and I found out later that there was a bet between 3 of the other girls in the class regarding who would get me to fuck them first and both of them were running interference on that, which I appreciated.

At the end of the day, a woman doesn’t really have much of a clue of what a man’s life is like. Women will give you terrible advice about how to handle your romantic affairs imo 

There’s that old saying “you are the company you keep.” When I finally started finding male friends I looked up to who were successful in many ways, my life changed

The great thing about these friends is they give me tough love. There is still a space to be emotional, but rather than coddling me, they tell me something along the lines of “feel whatever pain you need to feel, and then get back on the horse and improve yourself” whereas women will usually just agree with your pain and it’s not really helpful for self improvement

The other issue with opening up one self like that with women is you are putting yourself in a vulnerable position, for they now know your weaknesses and can easily use them against you for their own benefit, in turn making them lose respect for you as a “man” (mostly in relationships)

Typically if men have an issue they want to fix it and move on, so they go fishing, fixing a car, hunting, or whatever to help them process things and find a solution as fast as possible, often with other men can help that process exponentially. Women on the other hand love to get into the details and emotions of issues and not always want to fix themselves, as they would see the issue in the other person more than themselves.

n86verq,1mnrc8s,AskMen,AutoModerator,"Here's an original copy of /u/InformationDue1328's post (if available):

Hello,

  
I must confess, I am not really a smart person. Never finished school, or passed basic maths in school (I still count with my fingers). I forget easily too, I can't do anything at my part time job in a store unless I ask a thousand questions over tasks I have done many times. I always ask for help in college over coding for web development which I suck at and don't really know why I bother going to college. I can't read a book either, I can't picture anything in my head.

I don't really have any skills or achivmenets to show off either, every hobby I have ever tried from guitar and painting and drawing I have had no success and I don't find anything else interesting. I spent a while working in construction but decided to go to college becuase my old job wasn't working out as I was really short and struggled with the phsycil labour and I was too tired to workout after. But I suck at coding and even front end stuff too so the chances of me being successful in a web dev job isn't likely.

I sometimes wonder why I bother with my life, to be smart and quick thinking are pretty much required and I seem to possess none of them. My question is what to do with my life? Work ethic means nothing if you are a moron like me as you only ever hit brick walls. Any advice? I don't really have an issue with being a tard and dumb as that is just how I am but not sure how to live my life accordingly with this condition? (Can I call it that?).

Many thanks for reading.

n86wtma,1mnrc8s,AskMen,Brilliant-Dog9109,"It sounds like you have a high level of self-awareness. That is far rarer and more valuable than you might think. Most people cannot step back and articulate their perceived weaknesses with this kind of clarity.

“Smart” is not just about maths, coding, or remembering instructions. Problem-solving, perseverance, empathy, and the ability to see yourself without delusion are all forms of intelligence. You clearly have at least two of those.

Plenty of successful people struggled in formal education or never felt naturally talented. What made the difference was finding a setting where their strengths mattered more than their weaknesses. That might mean looking at work that is more hands-on, more practical, or more socially connected, rather than forcing yourself into a highly technical role that drains you.

With hobbies, the point is not to be “good” in the eyes of others. It is to enjoy them enough to keep coming back. Skills build quietly over time, but only if you are enjoying the process.

My advice:

Stop measuring yourself against the skills you do not have and start looking for where you have energy, patience, or curiosity. Those are clues.
Seek work that values consistency over complexity. Many industries prize reliability over raw intellect.
Keep learning, but on your terms. You might find small, structured courses or apprenticeships more suited than open-ended academic study.

Plenty of smart people can't do that. 

My guess is you might have a form of neurodivergence. The way you describe your frustration sounds like your brain works differently than most people. Sometimes that's worse, when reading is hard, but mostly it's just different.

Aphantasia is a condition that describes people who can't picture things in their minds. ADHD can severely impare memory. You don't sound stupid, you sound pretty amazing for getting as far as you have with the difficulties you face. 

IMO you should stop worrying about not being smart, and learn about how your brain actually works. Learn the strategies other similar people use to to improve. There are things that can make the difficult things easier. 

I used to think I was lazy because that's what my teachers told me. They were wrong, and it took me too long to realize the actual problem.

You might have adhd or maybe not. You just need a mentor or a guide for every course you want to do or any skill you learn. Hire a good teacher to spoon-feed you while you are learning, and after that, you will be good. Don't try to self-study. Your problem will be solved. The only problem is that you will have to pay money for it. If you can manage that. Then you will be fine.

For example, I was doing a course there, they didn't teach a specific topic DSA, so I bought that specific topic-related course, which was DSA- data structure and algorithms, from a well-known website. But that also didn't work for me. I understood that the teacher has poor teaching skills and is not structured according to my requirements. Then I got frustrated, and later I bought 3 more DSA courses at once on Udemy because it was cheap. I would rather save my time than a small amount of money.

n8eonov,1motnj2,AskMen,AutoModerator,"Here's an original copy of /u/Annual_Sign_2261's post (if available):

Let’s say you have a long-term girlfriend that you’ve been exclusive with for years. 

Let’s say you become acquainted with another girl (through a friend group, or as coworkers, etc), your girlfriend gets threatened by your companionship, and tells you to “stay away from her”, even if you were just friends in a company of other people. 

Would you then suddenly feel an even stronger itch to talk to that girl (out of spite? because the forbidden fruit is sweet? because you didn’t like being told what to do?)? 

P.S. not asking if you would actually act on it. I think most men would prioritize their girlfriend’s feelings as more important. But how would you FEEL on the inside?

n8f2w8q,1motnj2,AskMen,Loon_Cheese,"I disagree with this. Let me try and defend myself, while also saying I love that it works well for you.

“I have this saying work hard fuck hard.” It sounds aggressive, but I believe in balance/duality. 

I don’t want to work harder than I play, and vice versa. I also am not interested in friendships were we always hang out and there is no depth, conversely, all depth and no chill.

I have a lot of friend groups, I love making people food, doing outdoor activities, run a fantasy league, and gaming. 

Across all these groups of friends I have 2-3 guys that I can have fun with and share deep conversations or share perspectives that help to work through life and what it can throw at ya. Very few men want to do that, and have worked on that. 

I can think of maybe 9-12 women we have been close friends with over the years. Every time one of those was close to me first, when they met my wife, she grew just as close if not closer with them. 

There are probably two friends she has encouraged me to go visit out of town if she cant go and I find a cheap flight.

I explain all this to say that everything is about trust, insecurities, and expectations. I understand my partners expectations, how she wants me to have good friends, she has her own past and I can be aware of both of our insecurities, as well as we have a trust that we are each-other’s person.

No way either of us would peruse intimacy that would risk, we both know that, and every friend who gets close to us regardless of gender knows that pretty quick. I can’t say 100% because I don’t know their minds, but none of them made a move, or were getting some unhealthy needs met from me, or put out the vibe so to speak.

If either of us have the sense somebody is catching feelings, we change our medium of interaction. I have done with a cowork or two, but never felt the need to with one of the close friends.

Maybe it’s altruist, but I have to believe that deep meaningful friendships should not and can not be exclusive to same sex or people who are not attracted to your gender… it feels like a suffocation of life.

Perspective is valuable, the number of women in my life who I am close to and have shared some fucked up stories about men, is awfully high and it’s allowed me to gain perspective and have some conversations with men over the years I otherwise would not have.",1,2025-08-12 22:13:55,False,How would you feel about your long-term girlfriend forbidding you from talkng to other girls?,0,2025-08-12 20:24:39,47,,,,,,[]

Why is she so insecure in her feminity? She should get better instead of trying to punish him.

>How would you feel about your long-term girlfriend forbidding you from talkng to other girls?

So toxic and controlling.

>tells you to “stay away from her”, even if you were just friends in a company of other people

She is an abuser, we should make an app to publically shame her.

>But how would you FEEL on the inside?

I feel like he should call the police on her, she should get arrested for DA. 

/s

I think you get the idea, its quite revealing to reverse the roles when such things happen. But ultimately she cannot decide who his social circle is and who isn't. Each of us ultimately judge our own decisions and are the only person who will actually have to live with the consequences, as we cannot opt out of our life - unlike everyone else.

She can ask him to do so, but it's not a realistic request. It would do way more damage to his social circle if he were to completely ignore a human there, even explaining to others why will make him look like someone on the leash of a psycho. At work its even worse, such behavior could result in reduced work performance and can be interpreted as intentionally disruptive behavior to the work place. And if a supervisor or the boss asks what this is about ""my GF feels threatened by her"" will sound ridiculous, you would probably be asked ""would she also feel threatend if you lost your job?"".

So in the end when we feel discomfort about a situation it is up to us to change it. She feels uneasy, she must do the work and find out why she feels like that in the first place, he cant do this self reflective work for her, nor has he the obligation to flip his entire social circle to accomodate her feelings. If she has trust issues, she has to figure out why, not him. If she cant do either and still finds the situation unacceptable she can leave.

To answer your question, I did answer OP more directly in another comment. Short answer, a little, but not much. 

Longer answer, and a little expanded, for a new person, if my girlfriend could articulate a real, valid reason the new girl was an issue, then I would hear her out and we could talk about dropping new girl. Probably would in that scenario. But if it's just a bad feeling, no articulable reason, then that's really not enough. My girlfriend could absolutely come along if she wanted, and if the new girl ever tried anything inappropriate I would let my girlfriend know and cut contact with the new girl, but I'm not going to prejudge bad intent just because of social norms that I think are pretty outdated now.

When we get together with someone, we either trust them to remain loyal to us or we don't.

""Masculine"" and ""feminine"" are leftovers from past attempts to corral men and women into specific lanes to establish a gender hierarchy. It needlessly labels certain personality traits or characteristics as masculine or feminine, in an attempt to discourage those traits in the opposite gender. The traits for men were tied to leadership and strength. The traits for women were tied to submissiveness and frailty/delicateness.

I'm going to be confident, which is typically called masculine. But why is it considered that? The woman I am seeing right now is certainly confident herself. Is she masculine too then? I'm also going to be kind, thoughtful, and gentle - traits more typically ties to being feminine. Am I no longer masculine then if I have ""feminine"" traits too?

n8a5ajw,1mo1511,AskMen,Homely_Bonfire,"I personally learnt most of it through Mike Maloneys ""Guide To Invest In Gold & Silver"" (book and audiobook, I got both) which counter to its title is 90% economic history. The free Youtube Series ""Hidden Secrets of Money"" is also based on the book, but has less examples and is less in depth - still very much worth a watch especially Episode 1, 2, 7, 9 and 10 center around the historic aspects. Lastly, the man did a pretty interesting read of a historic analysis about ""[The Eerie Similarities of 1929 Crash and Today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCjWdAEh-EU)"" which I found helpful to understand in what kind of historical context economically speaking we are living.

Thomas Sowells ""Basic Economics"" Is also a very good source, but its a tough book to read, not all that nice to read as an introduction, I would leave that for later. There are also some very intersting interviews with Thomas Sowell on the Youtube Channel of the Hoover Instutition.

Personally I also looked into Marx a bit, even though as a person who grew up in former East Germany, I had plenty of reminders around me that these ideas don't work any better than fascism. Just seemed worth learning about what people did in the past. 

Something more particular that I liked was a guy called Neil McCoy-Ward acquired some diaries from people living during the Great Depression in the US and made a small series about those, this was very interesting. There is also a cooking channel of a nice old lady who lived in that era and she shares recipies from that time and some personal stories from back then, which is also a nice way to learn more about such a time.

There are also various resources online and books on ancient greek, roman and medieval economics, though I don't really have a ""to go"" kind of place. The BBC did some decent documetaries about it back in the day though I am not sure how much of that still remains accessible to the public.

In the end I cant say that this is ""the right way"" to study this, I can only say that I started out 5 figures in negative networth 8 years ago and with what I learnt since then, working an average job I got to mid 5 figures in savings and investments.

The first time she left, she seemed happy to leave and happy to have left. She boasted about the great life she was going to have without me. I was absolutely devastated and in a very dark place. When I started to move on, she wanted back in. After marriage, counseling, lawyers, and time spent dating each other, we got a new place together, but then she left again.

After the second time she left, knowing she came out of the closet, added the final nail to the coffin, but I was also angry. I was angry at being used while she figured herself out, and feeling our marriage and relationship was based on a lie.

My divorce was finalized in 2017. Looking back, it’s all water under the bridge. I wish her the best, but I’m glad the marriage is over. The relationship felt empty, shallow, and I never felt truly loved and appreciated, with reason I suppose. My last relationship ended before the pandemic began, and I’ve been single for five years.

Here I am.

I married the love of my life, but everything changed once we got married. And I mean it, right after getting married, for instance we did not have sex the night of the wedding and soon after I found myself in a sexless marriage, as well as other ""problems"".

The funny thing is that when we were dating our sex life was frequent, awesomely good, and wild AF.

Oh well.

I tried, I tried hard to rescue the married, I tried it all. There was no way.  Part of me was still in love with the girlfriend that I married, and not the wife that I found myself with. We had fights practically every day.

So, one day I called it quit. I told myself *anything BUT this*, I was so unhappy!

So I filed for divorce and that was it.

And I found myself in my very early 30's, young divorcee, and I was looking to have some fun.  Boy oh boy I was in for a surprise.

All the age-appropriate women wanted nothing to do with having fun, they were all business, they wanted to get married and have kids *soon*. Dates felt like job interviews, more than once I was asked my salary and how much money I had saved during the first date. LOL.

Oh well.

I am a pragmatic guy, so I found the solution: I started dating younger women in their early to mid 20's, mostly grad students; as well as women in their early 40's mostly fresh divorcees.  It was great!  That too got... *tiring* so I opted for FWBs/situationship; much better than dating.  I sowed more than my fair share of wild oats.

n88sa7i,1mnqfth,AskMen,Homely_Bonfire,">On the Ask Women Over 40 sub you hear lots of women talk about how they are so much happier after divorce.

Of course you would. The sisterhood likes sticking together, they also are very community driven and they are a lot about affirmation, but being harsh on one another it not exactly seen as acceptable but as ""toxic"" or ""shaming"". So telling other women that divorce is oh so great for them does a couple of things (which for some will be true but for all?). Just like some pathologic single women try to keep other women single for the reason of intrasexual competition (""How could *SHE* get a fine boyfriend when I cant?! Better sabotage it so I don't feel left behind.""), there are pathologic divorced women who loath everyone with a functioning relationship. They will go around and try to stir up trouble, create drama and make suggestions that are detrimental to a marriage (but probably fine for an open relationship or a single woman) to drive each other apart. And for the ultimate goal, the height of the power rush, they will say that the divorce is no big thing she will be happier after.

But are they happier afterwards? - Short answer: No. The CDC has gathered data on the subject and found that divorced women were almost twice as likely to take anti depressants as never-married or still married women. Data also indicates that with higher age the usage of anti depressants increases. Now put that together: An older, divorced woman takes anti-depressants, goes online and tries to get affirmation for her life choices to feel even better by saying she is doing better since she has separated.  

Again, this is definitely not ALL of them, it doesn't need to be, because the internet amplifies voices irregularly. And the wife or taken woman has probably more to do than the divorced lady home alone. Guess who will have more time to share her story online and guess what empathetic women will do when they read this knowing that it would be pretty harsh to say ""yeah you f\*cked up gurl"" since she couldn't undo it even if she wanted. ***The internet distorts the whole perspective because it is not a neutral medium.***

>It’s conventional wisdom that women are usually better off and men worse off

Looking at how women file 80% of divorces and are therefore prepared, while men are often times affected by divorce with life long payments, loss of custody of their children and even reputation destruction in the divorce court, it's not exactly surprising that divorced men do worse. They also are less likely to take antidepressants - though other substance abuse that do not mask their emotions may occur.

Can't remember how long they had been married, but it was long enough that under the laws in place at the time, his wife had qualified for lifetime alimony. We both started at the same company on the same day, and he was in his late 50s by that point, and divorced from his ex for over 25 years. Their two kids were in their 30s, married, and had families of their own. But within days of starting at this new company, he got a copy of a petition to the court from his ex-wife requesting an increase in alimony payments due to his new job.

A good full body weightlifting workout will do you good, you need to build a foundation so look for a 3-5day program that incorporates multiple compound lifts and a mixture of upper and lower on each day.  Focus on hitting an 8-12 rep range and going until muscle failure every set.  If you’re too far above or below the 8-12 range adjust the weight accordingly.  

Go to failure, hit your macros, and eat your biggest meal right after a workout.  Average your weight each week and that will give you a better idea on your progress.  If you don’t gain weight even at the caloric surplus you have right now, up it another 4-500 calories all towards carbs.  As you gain weight you’ll have to readjust your calories as well.

\-do something that you enjoy. You will eventually get tired of training if you don't enjoy it

\-people kind of notice eventually. It is not true that all girls care, but many do

\-removing cardio is a bit of a myth. I did a lot of cyclette and coudl still improve. I also think it makes for great leg training, even if it doesn't hit everything. At some point I ran a marathon in that period

\-do lat pulldowns. That back will make you look massive. If you are only going for looks, also focus on shoulders (lateral raises, overhead press are enough). If you are going for looks, let those abs show

It is true that real results will come in at least a year, but you should look bigger and improve slightly at every session if you went from doing nothing to going to the gym. If you are not, train harder per set

n8d8oih,1mokigh,AskMen,MannysBeard,"Don’t try to get big fast. Focus on getting bigger the right way. Slow and steady growth. You’ll thank yourself for it in the long run

It doesn’t matter if you eat once a day or 20 times a day. Caloric surplus is the same regardless (there have been many studies on this). Just don’t go crazy or you’ll put on a heap of fat that will take months to dust down later, wasting time you could’ve saved by simply being in a moderate surplus

Lift with a proven routine (upper/lower, push/pull/legs, etc) using both compound and isolation movements, and take your sets within 1-3 reps of failure. There’s no perfect rep range, you can grow muscle between 5-30 reps, but some exercises (compounds) are better suited to lower reps and others higher (isolations), due to fatigue and maintaining form.

Eat from 0.7-1g of protein per pound of your own bodyweight per day

Get adequate rest, track everything. Be consistent. Turn up on the days you don’t feel like it. Adjust and tweak as required

If you want to make sure you’re doing this properly, hire a coach. Some people I can recommend you follow on socials (sone also do coaching: Sean Nalewanyj, Dr Allan Bacon, Jay from aworkoutroutine.com)

n8dfvck,1mokigh,AskMen,usernamescifi,"Just because you're inputting it in an app doesn't mean that's an accurate record of your caloric intake. 


Although, tracking what you eat is very important. However, you need to understand that it's rarely a perfect science. 


For one thing calorie labels on foods are not perfect. Some counts have been found to be off by a margin of ±10%. Also, and more likely, portion sizes are another thing that people usually get wrong. Measuring portion sizes based on volume is convenient, but the room for error is significant, and it's also nowhere near as reliable as weight/mass based measurements are. 


I'm also not familiar with the mynetdiary app, but if it's anything like MyFitnessPal with the food search function, then most of those results you get are not accurate at all. 


Then, there is the matter of your daily caloric expenditure. What is your training routine like, and how many active calories are you burning per day? 2700Cal is all well and good, but that's honestly not a significant amount above what I suspect your basal metabolic rate to be, and factor in regular gym sessions then I'm honestly not surprised that you aren't gaining weight. ",1,2025-08-12 15:51:45,False,How can I get bigger fast?,0,2025-08-12 13:47:35,36,,,,,,[]

n82wegq,1mn6zi5,AskMen,BoerInDieWoestyn,"TL;DR - I was lonely, she was available and it was easier than trying to get laid through other means.

I was friends with this woman for a long time. We had similar subjects at uni and our friend groups kind of overlapped and later became one group. She was the type of person who wasn't scared of her sexuality and would make sex jokes with everyone and would even tell us about her sex life. I thought she was fun and quirky but I never had any intentions so start a relationship with her and I didn't really find her super attractive. Then one day she comes over to my place just to hang out like we've done many times before, and we got to drinking. I came out of a pretty bad relationship not long before that day and I was lonely and in my feelings. The mood I was in, her openly sexual personality and the alcohol all mixed together and as I was saying goodbye to her at her car I leaned in and kissed her. She responded to the kiss with some enthusiasm. We dated for about a year, I had some of the craziest sex of my life but it turns out being horny can only sustain a relationship for so long. She broke up with me after an ill-timed joke on my part, but when it was over I actually felt relieved because it's hard to be in a relationship with someone you don't find very attractive.

I had the hot crazy wife, and I will never go through that hell again.  One thing you realize as you get older is that there has to be something other than sex.  If your girlfriend isn't really your friend, then eventually the relationship will crumble.  This woman is super easy to talk to, has a huge heart, and has a sexy southern accent.  Eventually, everything on the inside won me over.  On top of all of that, the only things she wants from me are my time and my body.  She's not looking for a retirement plan or a place to stay.

Wife decided she was not having enough fun with me, and has been gone almost 2 years. There's several women at work that I consider friends. A few are becoming way more concerned about whether I'm working on machines near them. The one in question became way more touchy after me working on her tour for a project, and was in her immediate work area for hours each day that week as part of what I was working on. Never spent long periods of time with her before this, as she operates the machines and I am on call to fix them, usually not even having the opportunity for more than 10-30 minutes of talking while I'm working on her machine to get it operational ASAP. But many of those little times add up though. She's so smart, and hard working and stubborn. Also hugs me any time I even have a hint of receptive body language. Who knows where it could go? I will say my last relationship taught me that a woman that truly cares about you and has been honest with you for years and time spent with her doesn't have that terror of offending a newly met possible romantic interest. The fact that the only reason I haven't pursued it yet is because she's cool as shit and the friendship is valuable enough to really consider all the factors before even risking it. My best friend knows her too, and so works there. He says we've had a clear attraction  for awhile, but I'm autistic and it's hard to change that status in my mind. But after he pointed out that week of extensive interaction seems to helped me catch up with my subconscious. She's been off for two weeks on vacation and is back tonight. It's possible things could even progress tonight. I don't know really, but I'm open to a caring loving partner that is actually on my team and she definitely is, but not 100% on whether I'm already absolutely just solidly just her friend because her body language is different.

I would suggest buying him a beard care kit (works for mustaches too)(, shampoo, conditioner, beard balm, beard oil). 

When you present the kit to him say something like “I saw this and thought of you, it’s something about a man that has a lovely mustache/beard”. Incur the chapstick in the gift bag too.

Likewise with the chapstick, “Soft lips make me want to kiss you more”

I always had a problem having products on my skin and even more on my face. Not the products to wash under the shower tho.

I hate more than anything the creams like sunscreen cream or any skincare cream. One way I found to alleviate the disgust of the cream, is using product with different texture and having my gf applying it to me. 


I also hate having something on my lips, chapstick or anything. But I know for a fact, that I enjoy having a kiss from my gf with chapstick on, that's an opportunity to be a bit intimate but also usefull for my lips.

I'm big on skin to skin contact with my gf, and even though cream is still a no go with my gf, other textures can be as much healthy for the skin, in some situations also more enjoyable.",1,2025-08-11 18:38:15,False,How to tell a guy their hygiene is a turn off?,373,2025-08-10 21:30:26,237,,,,,,[]

I struggled with it as a teenager and got treated for it by a dermatologist.  Still on rare occasions have flare ups (usually when stressed out for some reason) and get a little bit of flakiness/dryness in my beard area and eyebrows. That being said, if that's the case, he could see a doctor about getting treatment for it.  The peeling lips may or may not be related (I've never had that issue even when my psoriasis was much worse as a teenager).

Can't really say the same for the dirty nails.  I've found that showering regularly and keeping the nails trimmed usually keeps them clean.  Don't know what the guy does for a living, but maybe its a job that results in dirt getting under his nails between showers.  Or he just doesn't take care of them.

And on a more serious note - just share with him and express your concern. Tell him exactly what you have here in your Reddit post. You want to advance your relationship and you are willing to help. He either will do something about it or his ego will reject the idea of changing because a partner told him so.

There is no easy way of saying to someone that their hygiene is not ok. And we can see that you have some concerns about how to do it. But you will have to have this talk eventually if you want a joint future with him.

The other option is to just move on and not bother, but you seem like a person who likes giving chance to others.
Only you know what is best for you, so do whatever will make your soul at ease. Obviously you want to share with him and you want to make it in the best possible way, so your connection doesn't suffer. But telling the truth is always inconvenient.

I would say you should embrace your situation and try your best to make it grow by letting him know that he should care more about his skin care. There is nothing wrong in letting him know that this is a concern for you. And the rest of it is his part. His reaction will tell you a lot about his real feelings.

n8291is,1mn3mcq,AskMen,Iamdalfin,"I agree with this perspective and method! I struggle with hyperhidrosis from one medication, and I therefore need another medication to treat me for said hyperhidrosis, lol. It gives me terrible dry mouth, dry skin, chapped lips, etc. that I try to treat daily (and can't seem to even drink enough water to combat it, even though it's several quarts a day!). 

I hear what the others are saying about hygiene; it often being a pattern and bad past experiences and such. It definitely could be true! But perhaps at least give him a chance to talk about it or explain? Mental health issues like depression could easily be another possibility; it's very common, and mostly treatable. I also think of my extended farmer relatives, and how dirty nails aren't a big deal in their community.

If you were to be gently inquisitive like the commentor above said, I would try saying something like this ""I noticed you have some very chapped lips, that must be uncomfortable to deal with. It's also a sign of severe dehydration. Have you tried specific strategies to treat it?"" 

If you were to put it all out there, I would say: ""Sooo, here's the deal. I really like you. You're checking all of the boxes for me [mention all the good qualities?], except for one thing that I think could be better managed, and to your benefit. Good hygiene and taking care of oneself is really important to me in a relationship, and I noticed a few things that I'm unsure about. I say this with all due respect, and with sensitivity to the possibility that these are due to medical issues, low self confidence, how you were raised, and/or perhaps even lack of knowing that you can actually treat these things and what solutions are out there to help. Specifically, I noticed you have dirty fingernails, very chapped lips, and flaky skin in your beard. Would you mind sharing more about these things to help me understand your perspective on it?

This post is about a man who (probably) doesn't properly take care of himself and his outer appearance. And you're lamenting that some men aren't complimented? Yeah, no kidding, WHAT FOR?

Men like you really want to be coddled and praised for the most basic stuff.

As a woman, you think people compliment me for regular-soft hands, washed hair without flakes or a neat appearance? Fuck no! I can spend hours per week on my dry, wavy hair but other people won't know or notice that. I spent a lot of energy and money on skincare, so now my skin looks great. Again, no compliments (and I didn't expect any). Maybe - ONLY MAYBE - if I go all out for an event with make-up, hair, dress, I get a compliment. If I get this compliment, it's probably from another woman. For a nice or new garment I might also get a random compliment from another _woman_, never a man.

n8705ab,1mn3mcq,AskMen,Kiyone11,"So you're the type of guy that can't distinguish between what counts as making a compliment and harassment. That's really not surprising.

It also appears you didn't understand anything in my comment which is truly baffling. 

Nowhere did I complain about random men not complimenting me, I _would_ be completely fine with that.

I wanted to emphasize that the majority of compliments women receive are from other women. Whenever compliments come up on Reddit some guy like you appears to complain about the lack of compliments men receive - and somehow the burden to change that and the blame for that is always on women. Why is that?

Women do their part. In my surroundings, they compliment other women, partners and friends. In my personal experience, it's men who are pretty frugal with complimenting others. But the men could also compliment each other? Many men want to receive without giving anything - while then not even realizing when they're getting a compliment.

I also don't know how you know that I ""refuse to compliment men"".

Now onto the guy OP had a date with:

I guess my opinion on how he takes or doesn't take care of himself is as relevant as the one from any other person in this thread. And yeah, it was kinda the topic. I even said ""probably"" as it might be the case that he already tried a lot of stuff for his problems but just wasn't successful. But let's be real here, it's really not the most probable.

I also never said he's not ""worthy"" of compliments 🤨   But why should an adult compliment another adult, nearly a stranger, for the MOST BASIC stuff like taking care of his chapped lips or hair? Man, we all do that.

Talking to my dad one day, he told me how ""invincible"" he felt when he was a teenager, and he kind of assumed every man feels like that at some point. He was a strong guy, very active and attracted a lot of women.

I'm the complete opposite lol I have never felt that way. I've always been insecure and the little confidence I have I gained it little by little, plus I've always felt different from other men.

Is it true there is something about being a man that makes you feel invincible? Do teenage boys feel like that? Or some men feel like that theoughout their lives? Or is it not a universal thing?

We'd work a couple hours then get sent home when the lunch rush died down, only to be called back because it'd inevitably pick up when people got out of work a few hours later.

What really pissed me off is when I re-enlisted in the Army. The GM didn't like that. Not only did he demote me back down to part-time, which meant I was back to being ""on-call"",  he transferred me to another location on the other side of the city. So I had to wait for a call that I knew would eventually come only to wind up driving 20 extra minutes to work *maybe* 3 hours, get sent home, then get another call at around 4 that afternoon.

i’ve struggled with this question a long time, but just now i was at the grocery store very tired and just minding my business when a man came up to me and immediately said “hi, where are you from ?” i answered a few of his questions out of politeness but at some point a stranger asking me private questions about my upbringing felt clearly overwhelming so i just said “listen, i live with my boyfriend” and it was clear he was upset or disappointed and he got suddenly defensive. it ended with just me saying bye have a nice day. 
i am quite socially awkward too so that doesn’t help, but i never know what to say or how to politely tell a stranger who is flirting with me that i’m not interested. so men, how do you prefer that a woman communicate that to you ?

Do not explain, justify, or defend it.  ""I'm just not interested.""   That's all you have to say.  And then move on, and keep it moving.  Do not say ""I have a boyfriend"". Do not say anything other than ""I'm not interested.""

Two things.  ""I am not interested"" and then move away from him, walk away with purpose as if you know where you are going.  Do not be tentative, hesitant, pensive, or apologetic.   ""I'm not interested"" and then walk away.

In your situation, you need to understand - if a man in a public place is trying to chat you up, he's interested in you sexually.  You must immediately shut that down by expressing your disinterest and moving away. Don't engage him.  Don't be ""polite"".  Don't make small talk.

But I never put the kids in the middle EVER. Neither did she. That’s the only positive. 

I felt exactly like you, man. Now I ride my motorcycle, my mountain bike, play disc golf, my drums, and I work.

I hit on women on the mountain bike trail too and have gotten a few dates that way haha. It’s a ripe time to approach in a respectful way because most men are scared to do it. I don’t give a fuck. 

I wasn’t cheated on that I know of, but man I know how you feel with the empty house and whatnot. I just text my kids (17 & 21) if I want to chat with them, or I’ll call them sometimes when they’re not here. You deserve access to your kids.

When you are a really involved father it feels like a part of your soul is missing. How much time has it been? How much time do you get with the children. I am almost a year since separation, and it still feels awful, but you do sort of come to terms with it.

It is no criticism at all, but one thing that helps me is to accept my own part in the failure. One of the things that is hardest to come to terms with is the injustice of a separation if you have invested so much of yourself and given everything. 

That is my situation, and it helps me at times to think 'well I married the vacuous narcissistic idiot and I can't say that there were not red flags'. It may be nuts but there is something to that which helps the resentment.

In terms of missing your kids, well, nothing is going to solve that. You just have to try things and see what works for you. Getting a dog idea is probably the best idea so far.

n83xhn4,1mmzklr,AskMen,adult-multi-vitamin,"Honestly, asking for help is the best thing you could have done. We are social animals and not meant to face life’s hardships alone. 

Therapy is a good place to start. You are literally paying someone to listen to your problems w/o judging you. Depending on your history you may go 6 times or 60. 

I started going to a gym at 5a bc the time worked with my schedule, and after 18 mos I’ve become friends with some really cool people. Sometimes we meet for drinks and it’s nice to run into them in town. The camaraderie has been a nice surprise. 

Stay in touch with your kids even when they are with their mom. Don’t use them as a crutch for your loneliness though. Just let them know you are there and you love and support them no matter what. 

I’m a big fan of eating dinner at the bar. It gets me out of the house. The bartenders are generally great. Beware the regulars though…you don’t want to end up like them. They’ll talk your ear off about how miserable they are or how life is unfair. 

Dating via the apps is a mixed bag. You’ve got to have thick skin and a strong stomach. But, I’ve met some ok dudes and had a couple of mini-relationships. Figure out what you can reasonably give to another person and act accordingly. Just don’t be a d*ck. 

If you decide to get a dog, know that they are essentially another child. Do you want that level of commitment/responsibility right now? 

Try to stay out of your head. You’re going through a terribly rough time right now. It will get better, but rumination doesn’t help. Mindfulness is a skill and this is a great time to learn it.

n8648gw,1mmzklr,AskMen,ZardozSama,"You start by dealing with the situation as it is.  I have no direct experience of this sort beyond my brother going through his own version of this, and my own parents divorcing.

If you have not done so, depending on how recent this series of events is, you need take a metaphorical minute to collect yourself.    This kind of shit hurts.  It is ok for it to hurt.

Based on your post, your personal life is basically devastated (no family and friends in the local area).

If you need to stay in the area for the kids, then you are going to need to rebuild your social life.  The whole 'how the fuck to I make friends as an adult' thing is a recurring question in r/AskMen, r/Adulting, and r/TooAfraidToAsk .  Doing so requires time, effort, and probably money on your part.  Leverage your hobbies if possible, and put yourself in situations where you are doing something you give a shit about and are surrounded by people.  

It does not matter what 'the thing' is.  Doing martial arts, going to church, taking a cooking class, or playing Warhammer 40k or friendly poker game are all viable.  The common element is you need to do the thing regularly and the thing should ideally facilitate conversation beyond trivial small talk.

Once you have rebuilt some kind of worthwhile social life, then you can look for a new relationship.  Take your time with that one and make sure you have your shit together emotionally.

Also, you do not need to necessarily forgive your ex-wife for cheating on you.  You do need to deal with it to the point where you can be in the same room and have a civilized conversation with them without it being hostile.  You will also need to be able to interact with your kids without trauma dumping your anger and grief on your kids.  In this context, you need to be the adult, which means you need to support them, especially if they are young.

I’m now a kind man who knows what he offers, and honestly, I’m not holding out hope that there’s a woman who can match my energy, but I’m betting the divorced women are the best shot because they’ve already been in a fucked up and failed relationship.

n8aqvt7,1moaxbh,AskMen,AutoModerator,"Here's an original copy of /u/expert_advice's post (if available):

I'm 30M, and I was chubby until I was 13. When I got into sports (parkour and running), I lost a lot of weight and never had trouble getting dates or attending social events. Then in 2019, depression hit me, and then covid. I became so inactive that my fat bank was breaking personal records in profits. Needless to say, my libido tanked, and I missed out on any team activities at work and in my hobbies. My confidence was at an all-time low.

6 months ago, I got a gym membership and have been working hard since. I refreshed my wardrobe and picked up some tight t-shirts. To my surprise, I started getting more attention quicker than I expected - side-eyes, smiling cashiers and baristas (same coffee shops I’ve always gone to). I even got free coffee and a pastry after a short conversation. Friends have given me compliments too. I'm currently cutting, and while I feel like I'm only halfway there, it still feels amazing to see my effort paying off.

My concern is that my focus has started shifting too much toward one area of improvement - my looks. I'm trying to find a better balance, since lately I've been neglecting work and some hobbies as I focus more on feeling ready to ""go out there"". It feels like I'm losing myself a bit, and the idea that my self-confidence hinges mostly on how others perceive me kind of sucks. I'm dipping my toes into the ocean of new experiences and excited to continue this journey, but it still feels like I don't deserve it, and I'm moving in the wrong direction. Sometimes it's all very contradictory in my head, even overwhelming.

Is this a temporary phase? Will I eventually grow into this new body and go back to my past self? What was your experience with a dramatic (or not-so-dramatic) change in appearance? How did you handle it? I don't want to sound superficial, but honestly, this is how I feel.

n84tlk5,1mnfx35,AskMen,ANBU_Black_0ps,"My strategy to solve any type of interpersonal issue is to just address it directly. 

""I've noticed/ you've communicated to me recently that you are feeling uneasy about me and our relationship and where you stand. What can I do, what do you need from me to feel reassured that you are important to me, and our relationship is a priority to me?""

This approach does 2 things first, it gets them in the habit of communicating their needs openly and directly. Also, by extension, it gets them out of the expectation that I'm a mind reader. 

But secondly, it allows me to not waste time and energy on things that don't matter to them or clarify things because it might be due to miscommunication. 

For example, when I'm talking to someone, I will frequently turn my phone screen side down. 

I do this because I want to give the person I'm talking to respect, and not be distracted by constantly glancing at all of the various notifications I get. 

However, Reddit has determined, and it has bled into other parts of social media, that this is a sign of cheating or that the partner is hiding something. 

But if we can talk about it directly and she tells me that my keeping my screen turned down makes her feel anxious, I can explain why I do it, which allows her to say, she doesn't care about me looking at notifications, but it will put her mind at ease even if she knows I'm not hiding anything.

Great, I'll just do that instead of me just calling her beautiful or complimenting her outfits, or buying her flowers, all of which she hopefully appreciates, but don't actually fix the problem because I'm trying to read her mind and do what I think she needs instead of just asking her what she actually needs. 

Lastly, as a bonus, it gives you the opportunity to see how she is with directly expressing her needs. 

If she's a person who is uncomfortable or unwilling to express her needs to you clearly and directly, that might not be reason enough to end things, but at least you'll know you are signing up for relationship hard mode and can prepare accordingly.",10,2025-08-11 09:19:54,False,How do you reassure your girlfriend/wife in your relationship?,15,2025-08-11 08:22:29,46,,,,,,[]

n84lkte,1mnfx35,AskMen,rabid_briefcase,"Why reassure?  Is this insecurity? Is this something with a rational basis? Also, why the boundary-crossing?

If she is accurately tracking something about you, that there is an area in your life you aren't trustworthy or reliable or otherwise behaving, then you can work on that. Actually be reliable, be trustworthy, be honest, and if you aren't, change, apologize, and do better. Don't lie to ""reassure"" that you are trustworthy if you genuinely are not. You control you, so work on that part of you.  That is, you can't *tell someone* you are trustworthy, you need to *behave that way*. 

If this is her insecurity, that's something she can work on. That's crossing the boundary of you trying to manage her feelings, which is a common codependent behavior.  In general people need to do their own work with insecurities, it isn't something others can do much about. Whether that is body image, self worth, or some negative self-talk, that's their own mental view that needs to shift. Telling someone ""no it isn't bad"", or ""you actually look good"", or ""you can trust me"" doesn't reassure them, doesn't take away the insecurity, doesn't deal with the underlying behavior. 

The question itself suggests a bigger issue around the boundaries than being trustworthy. It isn't your job to manage her feelings.

n86bcbp,1mnoelg,AskMen,Santi76,"My life is good I'm pretty happy. And the things im not happy about with my life have nothing to do with being single. Currently late 30s. Been single for over a decade. I had a bunch of girlfriends in my teens and 20s and reached a point back then where I decided the juice just wasn't worth the squeeze and have put zero effort into dating for the past decade.

I think ultimately, I'm happier this way. I'm super introverted and self motivated so it suits me. I am not closed off completely from ever dating again, but the woman would have to have a lot of common interests. The main thing I miss is obviously physical intimacy but also just having someone to do stuff with and travel with.

If I married and the woman really suited me, I may have been a little happier. But I know if I married and the woman wasnt that way I'd be far far less happy. So I probably made the right decision, none of my old girlfriends would have been good wives for me I don't think and I don't think the ideal woman for me really exists. There's some big pros and cons to being single but I think the pros for me outweigh the cons somewhat even if it's not by a ton.

That depends entirely on the person. Some people thrive and live very fulfilling and happy lives without having been in a single relationship their entire lives.

Where I went to church purity culture was very, very pervasive, and it was heavily taught that boys/men were scum, predators and pigs and so the girls and women were hostile at best and outright mean at worst. 

I saw a lot of toxic relationships/marriages (including my parents) and heard nothing but horrible things said about men and women, relationships and marriage.  

Serious dating was expressly forbidden before adulthood, and I knew from first hand experience that the girls at school and church would sooner suffer every from of torment from the Spanish Inquisition than give me the time of day.  

From the time I was 11 onward I was alone and friendless and had to learn to survive and thrive alone (that hasn't changed) because 98% of my experience with my peers consisted of death threats, violence, invalidation, humiliation and so on.   Some of those kids in 3rd to 5th grade were very capable of murder.

Had i grown up with the same experience I only hope id have made as good decisions as you have to get through all of that without getting harmed or having a criminal record. I think you made the right call.

That's the one saving grace about being a strong man. Even though it may not be preferred by most, a man can disconnect from social expectations and thrive on their own.

Its crazy, just knowing my own story (which doesn't hold a candle to yours in terms of difficulty) I know how hard things can be and how uncaring the world is for you unless you're providing it something. We hear so much today about how bad women have it, when the reality is that most of them cannot even conceptionalize how bad things could actually be in reality.

I built gaming PCs, owned every console, and co-played every Nintendo game with my son since the Wii. I raided Icecrown Citadel, explored Tamriel, survived in Rust… then hit 40 and just lost interest. At 42, I have to force myself to enjoy a game.

I don’t think I “grew up.” Two big changes killed it for me:

* No guilt-free personal time. As a middle manager, work is always lurking. I sit down to game and feel lousy about kids’ homework undone, the uncut lawn, or my wife being annoyed.
* Can’t suspend disbelief anymore. It used to be easy to be my character. Now I’m a balding, middle-aged guy with stubborn extra pounds—not some raid boss conqueror. I’m that neighbor with the overgrown yard and the garage door he forgot to close overnight.

My hobbies now need to leave something tangible: learning a guitar technique, helping my kids build something, finishing a grad-school course, cleaning out the garage. Virtual progress doesn’t cut it anymore.

n810d0g,1mmuztr,AskMen,KanePilk,"I'd love to have an answer to this, too.

  
I remember being a kid and literally from GTA 1 coming out, i was addicted. Every single console release was played to death. Over and over until the next one came out. In between the releases I read magazines (CVG, anyone?) and internet articles about the upcoming games.

  
GTA IV I lived in. Then when V came out and the handling of the cars was all cartoony, it kinda put me off. I figured I'd give it a go anyway and I'd get used to it, but it never happened, and I stopped playing it altogether.



Went back to IV a few times but it was never really as fun and eventually just stopped playing altogether. 

  
In the background, alongside the GTA series, I sunk days of my life into the likes of Metal Gear Solid and Theme Park World, Age of Empires and Final Fantasy 7/8. But none of them appealed to me once GTA V let me down. I just kinda went off gaming altogether.

  
Nowadays I literally never play games. My PS4 (I think its a 4 anyway) is covered in dust in the spare room and other than the odd glance in the direction of GTA VI because I see an ad for it being pushed at me, I just can't be bothered anymore.

Many modern games have these issues for me:

1. Optimization.  I have a brand new top of the line PC I built. I should not have stuttering, lag, or crashes in games yet many AAA games, especially UE5 have tons of issues.

2. Games are too big. Remember when you were a kid, you could play a game and beat it in a weekend. The gameplay didnt get stale because it was only maybe 10 hours long. Now days games are often 40+ hours minimum so they run out of ideas and allure after the first couple hours.

3. Every game thinks it needs to be a cinematic, story driven game. I dont need an entire 15 minute cutscene tutorial telling me why X badguy is bad and why im playing the game. One of my favorite games of all time is Streets or Rage 2. It gives you a 30 second opening crawl of the story and you are immediately in playing the game.

4. Lack of genuine creativity.  Games all look and play the same. Every AAA goes for hyperrealism instead of a cool art design.

n83r9k5,1mmuztr,AskMen,viper2369,"While I think part of it is getting older and priorities changing, but for me I think a large part of it is that games all now feel like a chore. 

Every game has some form of progression. Or “loot” that you need to chase. I never was a hardcore gamer, and mostly stuck to FPS or competitive type games. 

I played a lot of goldeneye, perfect dark, Mario cart, and halo. Never once was it to chase some useless “loot” in the game. I’d log into halo 2, 3, reach, or 4 and be playing a patch within minutes. Play a couple of hours, usually with friends, and go to bed. 

Now, if I log in it takes 15 minutes to get bounties and be “ready” to play.  Then you have to do certain activities. Destiny being the main example I’m thinking of, I just want to use the weapons I’m familiar with and play the game. Not have to use specific ones that I’m not good with. 

That’s not to take into account the “seasons” in games now.  Used too, we buy a game and play it however long we want. Now you have to keep paying to play it basically. So now it’s all a financial investment.  Which most aren’t going to keep dropping money into different games or series, so you kinda get stuck on one and then it turns into a sunken cost fallacy. And that’s not to get into micro transactions for appearance stuff. 

Even a game like Forza Horizon is like this.  There’s “so much” in the game that it feels overwhelming.  I’d have to spend so much time in the game to “do it all” that it’s not worth it. 

So TL:DR, I have enough chores and responsibilities, I don’t need another one if I’m going to play a game.",1,2025-08-11 06:01:35,False,Why don’t I like video games anymore like before?,198,2025-08-10 14:41:10,270,,,,,,[]

I feel I also do not like games anymore. But I find myself playing old gems very often. I recognize that nostalgia plays a major factor, but I've tried modern games and it simply doesn't cut anymore.

Most games nowadays are all the same. It seems all possible gameplay mechanics and loops was already discovered, and we're receiving more of the same.

Most games are movies, and this is fucking asinine. If I wanted to watch a movie, I wouldn't install it on Steam. This elevates the production cost and time of the development to almost 10 years, and the final product is boring, repetitive and non inspiring.

We're having a poor generation of games because devs made choices nobody asked. Mario KArt 64 online with a buddy gives me more entertainement than paying 80$ for dogshit Mario Kart World.

Games are just asset flips using the same engines, or, they're SO bad optmized that a blurry clusterfuck needs a 4090.

Better to find a longer well established show to watch cause I blew through that in 2 days and now I’m trying to find something else till I feel that urge again. When you do go back it feels very fresh and fun again… other tip is try some shit you normally wouldn’t even think about trying. I remember losing interest in everything and one day I decided to just try some weird shit and bought Persona 5. I sunk over 120hrs into the game and discovered a new genre that I like, I had never even looked at persona as remotely interesting but the change of pace and style from the games I normally played made the game very fun. If your more of shooter/fps/MP kinda guy try a game that’s nothing like those like Civilization, persona, etc. This game is not for everyone and I respect that but I will always recommend Death Stranding, game play isn’t exactly exciting per se as at its core it is just delivering packages but the story is by far the best I have seen in gaming.

There's no sense of teamplay anymore, every shooter is a cluster fuck of players jumping, emoting, lights, noise. Voice chat is dead. Everyone wants to get the kills, even if the game isn't about that. Vehicles are taxis. No tactics nor strategy. No communication. Grind, pose, buy.

I'm playing Balatro now. I'm not into poker or card games in general but it's fun. It's single player, it's casual, it's a good game.

Sometimes I play older games, Hell Let Loose or Squad, or casual shooters like Battlefront 2 or Marvels Rivals.

In 2012, friends noticed dust on the control pad.
2017, I had a go at GTA 5, but I really couldn't play with the kids around.
End of 2022 I wasn't sleeping, I saw a sleep psychologist (at the time we now know it was undiagnosed ADHD at 37) he told me to do ""stimulating, rewarding activities"" before bed, I joked and said ""like video games"". Since then, until 1130 at night I play video games. I really enjoyed RDR2, GTA5, and a few sniper games. But its not as fun as it used to be, I now do paint by numbers and watch TV series until 1000, but as im enjoying that more im starting the video games later.

I'm hanging for GTA6, and the goal is to get the PS5 when that comes out, but the date keeps getting pushed back, so I need to find something eles, but I might do more paint by numbers.

n8azpv9,1moagl6,AskMen,KermitML,"Agree with what others have said, whether or not its gay has more to do with the people involved than the activities you do. 

As far as the stigma, for a long time a man being gay was up there with the worst things he *could* be. To be publicly gay was to be ostracized in most cases. Gay people were thought to be mentally ill, perverted, and active detriments to society. None of this was true obviously, but gay people threatened patriarchal ideas about gender roles, so they were demonized and othered for a long time. An extension of that that is activities associated with being gay developed a stigma around them as well, even if they weren't inherently tied just to gay people.",2,2025-08-12 08:38:21,False,What do you think of butt play/prostate stimulation «is it “gay”?

n8b27l2,1moagl6,AskMen,ForYourAuralPleasure,"I think of it like this: does a prostate exam make you gay? No, of course it doesn’t. So right off the bat, we’ve established that you can allow objects/fingers in your butt without it being gay. We *could* end it there, but let’s move on. 

Does it make a difference if the doctor examining your prostate is a man? Are you gay now? No? Why not? Because you’re not receiving a prostate exam for pleasure? Is it because neither party is getting sexual pleasure? 

Say you’re in prison, and another man rapes you while you’re in there. Are you gay now? I would imagine most men would say no on the grounds of this *still* not being your choice and you’re *still* not receiving pleasure for it. I would wager that if that inmate said you can choose between him penetrating you or getting shivved, even if you chose the former, you’re still not deriving pleasure from this, even if the other man is, this *still* doesn’t make you gay. None of these experiences are going to make you desire pleasurable sexual experiences with other men against your will. 

But there are plenty of men who are with me on none of the aforementioned scenarios making them gay who *would* say that getting sexual pleasure from a woman putting fingers or other objects in your butt 100% makes a man gay, which ostensibly means there are men who will look you in the eye and say that a sexual encounter with a woman can make you gay in ways a man ejaculating in your butt won’t.

I grew up in Germany, as a Brit but the most I can bring myself to enjoying the game to any meaningful level is during finals where I can usually be found (much to my brother's annoyance) wearing German shirts. I am, without a doubt much more of a Cricket fan where I can spend three days checking my eyelids for holes if I so desire, or Rugby which for me is *much* more engaging.

So how do I mingle and not get beaten up for wearing an all blacks shirt during the rugby world cup and a germany shirt when it comes to enjoying the footie? I simply enjoy the vibe. Even with sports I enjoy I've found that it's better to pick up a ""for dummies"" book that explains the basics to familiarise myself with concepts, which leaves me completely free to enjoy the vibe with family and friends, and enjoy a beer.

Dashrarh Manjhi, otherwise known as The Mountain Man, carved a road through a mountain all by himself. The road is 360 feet long, 30 feet wide, and runs through a channel 25 feet tall. 

He split a mountain all because the love of his life died, and couldn't get from his small village to the nearest hospital because it would have taken too long. The distance between his village and the hospital was, before he carved the road, forty three miles. His road made the journey just over half a mile.

It took Manjhi 22 years to carve that road, from 1960 to 1982, and he did it all by hand. No power tools, no heavy construction equipment. Just a hammer and a chisel.

There are all types of men out there.  From suckers you can order around endlessly, to assholes who wouldn’t even give you their piss to put out the flames if you were on fire. 

Myself and most of my friends expect equal effort.  If you want me to move a mountain, you better be asking me to do it while carrying a shovel.

Many men are coming to see how a failure to evolve on their part has allowed women to take advantage of them.  There is no reason to play the part of a 1950’s man if I’m getting a 2020’s woman.  For a LONG time, men couldn’t let go of the ideals of yesteryear on what it means to be a man.  Many still can’t.  But a lot are coming around, and seeing the situation for what it is.

Hopefully this is the beginning of the end of women exploiting traditional masculine values for their own self enrichment.

If you want me to move mountains alone, and do all the heavy lifting myself, the house better be spotless when I get home, dinner on the table, laundry done and put away, all my clothes ironed, and you on your knees when I walk in the door.

n7ym3hm,1mmm3u6,AskMen,Antique_Soil9507,"This is a good comment. 

If you're waiting for a man to push mountains for you, you're not really in love. You don't really want a relationship. You want *control*.

I can see how that might feel very empowering to know you have the strength and determination of a male on your side. 

But if you're making him move mountains for you, then you aren't really using that power fairly. You're not really in it for the ""third body"" (the relationship). You're into it for yourself, for control, for the power it gives you. 

In my experience it has never turned out when a woman has asked me to move mountains, and I have. It was never enough. In fact, it was ""too much"". 

The best relationships are balanced, with both parties making an effort. 

So, if you are of the mentality that you are waiting for some guy to ""move mountains"", I think you need to reconsider your relationship with him, and what it is you actually want. 

A man can, but shouldn't have to, move mountains in order to make a relationship work.",181,2025-08-10 09:18:49,False,How true is the idea that a man in love will move mountains for the woman he loves?,303,2025-08-10 08:55:14,353,,,,,,[]
n81la2k,1mmm3u6,AskMen,iamfuturetrunks,"Very good description.

I have been there in some ways before. I was going to spend money and travel to visit a girl I like a lot, a number of times. Not necessarily moving mountains but I know if she got really hurt or something I would be booking a flight or traveling there however I could just to be there for her.

Unfortunately over the years constantly being burned trying to make plans to visit her has kinda ruined my trust in her. To the point where I can't trust she wont change her mind after I book a trip to see her, or if I were to get there and she decides not to meet up.

Also the unrequited love has taken a toll as well. She has said a long time ago how she also likes me the same, but the past few years it hasn't really felt like it. At one point last year she claimed it wasn't one sided which made me happy and hopeful for a short while but she never shows me or says anything to make me feel like it isn't one sided.

It really sucks cause I felt we were really compatible or had a lot of stuff in common and might be pretty happy together but she is flaky and the effort isn't matched and again at times feels one sided.

Unfortunately the more time passes the more I feel like I am not gonna find someone I like who likes me back. I know some people will claim ""you will find someone"" which isn't realistic. But also some may be like ""be patient"" and I am tired of waiting, I have already waited a very long time as it is, longer than what most people will be able to guess. Im tired of waiting, and im tired of always having to be the one to make all the efforts with nothing to show for it in the end.

Both people (in a monogamous relationship) need to give, and both should be able to receive. I'm a huge romantic, myself. Honestly, I need romance in a relationship, and that is both on the giving AND receiving end. I will do anything for the person I'm in love with, but if it's never reciprocated, I see that as a rejection of my love and as that person taking advantage of me.

Everytime I I thought about being with someone it would be like my mind clouded over and they were the enemy who caused all issues in a relationship. Best thing that happened was being shown i was wrong with such kindness and care. Gender/sex how ever you view has absolutely nothing to do with wether a person is bad or not. It's funny while I'm not trying for relationships I'm putting myself out there through here and other sites just making new friends online to chat to and it's mainly woman I'm chatting to.

Over the years, I’ve intentionally put myself in tough situations to build resilience — financially, mentally, emotionally. I’ve learned to handle stress, survive hardship, and stay strong no matter what. But now that I feel I can lock in mentally, I’ve realized I’ve become overly serious. I struggle to relax, and I feel like I’ve lost my sense of humor and ability to have fun.

I'm starting to regret trying to have the experience of a man who is 50, at half his age.

What do you do when you've built mental toughness but want to reconnect with lightness, joy, and fun again?

n81ur3l,1mmzgz2,AskMen,Vast_Monitor1579,"I've had this concern for many years. There's a loss of innocence when you endure hardships and grow up quickly. I was recently lamenting to a friend about how I feel so ""serious and responsible"" and like I've lost the fun parts of me (the playfulness, the humor, etc.). She assured me that wasn't the case and listed off all the things she finds fun about me. And while I truly appreciate her words, she didn't know me before all of the responsibility and burdens. Not to sound overly emotional, but this version of me really bums me out sometimes, and I worry that some of my favorite parts of me are gone. While I'm thankful I can serve certain communities better and advocate for those in need, it comes at a cost.


I don't have well-tested advice, sorry. But I do have hope. My friend and I brainstormed what might help me, and maybe it'll help you, too. I think **community and partnership** might be good places to start. I'm volunteering a significant amount of my time to more serious causes currently, but will soon be taking on some ""silly"" hobbies and getting back to the things I did before life became so heavy. I know there's no going back, but I'd like to recall those parts of me and see what can be integrated. And if I get in another relationship at some point, I am going to actively scan for signs of emotional maturity (bonus if they have childlike wonder). I want friends and a partner I can play with - someone who's mature enough to hold both the serious and silly parts of life.


**Note of caution:** 
It would likely be a painful mistake for you to get in a relationship with a childish person (assuming you're not already partnered). I understand the appeal of being with someone who actively avoids taking on the types of hardships and life experiences you've had (it can feel liberating initially), but there's a *major* difference between a childish and childlike person. 
- A **childish** person is immature, impulsive, and self-centered (i.e. no room for you). 
- A **childlike** person is curious, creative, and emotionally mature enough to make space for someone else's inner world.


It took me a long time to identify and define the difference.",1,2025-08-10 20:17:40,False,Taking on burdens young has made me not fun - how do I get that back,49,2025-08-10 18:02:37,38,,,,,,[]

Then I realized some of them had a lot more emotional development than me. They'd had room to breathe, to grow, to learn things I didn't. Yeah, I could handle more stressful situations, but it also meant that when I broke, I'd break a lot harder and handle it a lot worse sometimes. It wouldn't matter that they would have broken before me, or that they didn't have some of the tools I had. What mattered was they could open up without breaking down. They could cry instead of putting their fist through a wall just so they could feel enough pain to block out the sadness from the tears that didn't come. They still had light and life and humor.

n7x9jxf,1mmfdfw,AskMen,shsss98,"My husband is totally oblivious to women flirting with him. I find it funny, it’s also a telltale sign when it’s women of varying ages who do so. We worked together in real estate and when I first joined the team, one of the older ladies in our office introduced herself to me and then promptly, and vivaciously, told me that my husband “has hair that women just want to grab onto!” earning many agreeing nods and smirks from the other ladies. I tease my husband about this now.

He also happens to be a major nerd - like DnD, Warhammer 40k nerdy; He prefers reading and writing to most other hobbies, tells THE WORST dad jokes, loves listening to WWII history etc, so bearing this in mind, I think he doesn’t even consider himself “hot” (even though he most definitely is). 

People treat him differently for sure due to his looks. In conversations, men will listen to what he has to say and often agree with him, especially his boss and the company directors  - women will smile and laugh at his jokes emphatically. I have been asked many times by other women how to “get one of those,” to which I often smile and say, “sorry but there’s only one.” 

I think also I look bitchy so a lot of women my age tend to flirt less (like touching his arm, being overly smiley etc) when I’m in the convo with them and him. The second I leave though? lol. Older ladies don’t care though and will happily flirt and remark about his muscles etc.

n7x82ae,1mmfdfw,AskMen,Fireblazz_Phoenix,"Extremely easy to get a girlfriend?
Yes and No....
Meaning, if you're more shallow in your personality and just want someone for the sake of having one, you can get one pretty easily without a heck of a effort or courtship......but it will probably not last or leave you in better spirits long term.
You want hookups? You probably can get one fairly easily (I say probably since I'm not interested in hookups not ever will be so it's speculation on my part)


Women throw themselves at me?
Hmmmm.....depends on the woman tbh. There are some who can be quite bold and shoot their shot....so, I guess you can call it throwing? Though it's in a minority...


Women giving me constant signals to convey interest and want me to approach them? All the time, from practically a lot (if not almost all the ones I meet or don't even meet but they catch a look). A good portion don't bother with it (since I assume, and might have heard from a friend of a friend that he's way out of her league). But the very good looking ones signal me and if I'm interested, very very receptive to my approach .....

Dating?
Actually dating is still another ball game since you have to figure out compatibility, how you see things, philosophy, love, intelligence etc....Looks unfortunately *can* even be a problem in a bad way for you.....My ex wasn't the absolute best looking smoke show (she was still quite pretty in her own way), yet she was constantly very insecure about some other girl making moves on me and well....getting me for their company....even if it was for a short while. No matter how many times I assured her that I wasn't interested in the other girls, she'd always be paranoid and would always say that she trusts me 100% but doesn't trust other women to keep their hands off of me even 1% .....the relationship unfortunately broke...despite my best efforts (tbh, this wasn't much of an issue...there were other incompatible things unfortunately...I would have married her 100% if not for those issues...but well fate is fate I guess)


Other women reacting when they're around their bf's?

To be honest, depends on women and their relationship with their bf. Their bf is usually far, far more vigilant and *protective* that's for sure 100%. Some can get too clingy and try to show off that their gf is theirs... (Like, dude, I wasn't even interested in your girl, but thanks for making her uncomfortable and showing her how insecure you are apparently)

A lot of times, those women act nice and courteous especially if their bf if around and watching (trust me, he's watching), but if he's not around ......then things can get more....hmmm...open and slightly flirty? Like, I'll be honest, for some women, the way they act when their bf is around vis-a-vis when he's not is literally night and day....for others, not much of a difference.

But you can feel the tension for sure 100% (at least for some women, not all)

n7xkwaf,1mmfdfw,AskMen,G4M35,"This is a tough question to answer. Honestly, I don't think I am *""handsome""*, but life's experience has demonstrated with facts, that a decent number of women find me *""attractive""*, especially after I transformed my body from skinnyfat to toned/muscular; and I took care of my mental issues (depression and anxiety).

It's fucking awesome! LOL

> Is it extremely easy to get a girlfriend?

Absolutely yes.

> Do women throw themselves at you in general?

No, but there are signs.

Here's an interesting true story that happened to me. It was Halloween season, I was in one of those Halloween costume stores, waiting in line for the dressing room. This very pretty woman walks by, she punches me twice (gently) on the shoulder and says *""You know you are very good looking, right?""*  and walked away. I was flabbergasted!

She was a customer, and later on I saw her in the store, I approached her and we started to talk, she had a crop top showing a nice large tattoo on her lower back.  [LOL, I know]

We left together, went to a bar, had a couple of drinks, then went to her place and fucked like horny rabbits.

So, there's that.

That was not my life before I started lifting hard at the gym, and while I was crippled with depression and anxiety.",20,2025-08-10 05:47:27,False,What's it like being handsome?,563,2025-08-10 03:43:42,392,,,,,,[]
n7ybnnk,1mmfdfw,AskMen,Character-Set-8243,"One thing I learned was that women will make it unbelievably easy for you if they find you attractive.

 I cold approached this one girl she gave me her number and I called her to make sure. She was cute. 3 hours later she calls me. That had never happened before. She called me nearly everyday after that. She initiated texts she told me literally everything about how her day went unprompted she vented to me, all within the first few days. She invited herself over for a movie, halfway through she tells me to turn it off and she started making out with me... 

In highschool I got approached by girls a lot. They will send their friends to tell you they like you, they will pretend to be the friend of the girl who has a crush on you meanwhile it's them who's the girl who has a crush on you, they will greenlight you hardcore, or they'll straight up tell you they're into you. 

This one time I went to a different school for a week for an event we had. I became a celebrity overnight. Everyone knew all the girls there wanted me and they weren't shy to make it clear. Needless to say I dated the best looking girl I found there. It lasted 5 months and I broke up with her. Her classmate (the 3rd best looking there) hit me up 2 days later and asked me to make her my girlfriend. After that ended my girl best friend asked me the same thing a week later.

They will put up with nearly anything. I've been called an asshole and she stayed. I've made her cry and she stayed. Her friends have told her to leave me and she stayed. I've cussed her out and she stayed. I've broken up with her and she's begged to stay with me. Women will be submissive and obedient to you, they will flaunt you around.

They'll ignore your deficiencies. I'm short. Generally girls want tall guys. I've been approached by girls taller than me before. Yeah , taller. 

People gossip about you. It can get annoying. People you don't even know will know your name and you'll be confused if maybe you met them before and rudely forgot their name.

People will wanna be friends with you and go out of their way to get to know you.

You'll get complimented a lot. By friends, by family even strangers.

You'll get compared to others. People will compare themselves to you or you with someone they know.

You'll catch girls staring at you a lot.

Sometimes you'll have insecurities with your looks, other times you may not be able to stop looking at yourself.

You'll have some girls that will be obsessed with you. It's not nice at all. This one girl just wouldn't take no for an answer. I swear I started out polite, I even got to know her to give her a shot she was so persistent. I ended up having to block her.

Gay guys will shoot their shot every once in a while. They may even touch you inappropriately. It's really uncomfortable. This one dude literally begged to see my c***. I was friends with him and had no clue he was bi. We were drunk and I decided to let him stay over. He asked me not to tell anyone he was bi after. Similar other situations have happened.

Girls will buy you things. They'll find excuses to get you things, maybe find out your birthday or say it's just cause you're friends. They'll be more willing to pay for things.

They'll make excuses to spend time with you. Asking you for help with something is the most common.

Women will cheat on their boyfriends with you. This one really fucked me up NGL. I'm not sure I wanna get married anymore. Some of the girls are so innocent looking you wouldn't suspect a thing.

Girls will slide into your dms. Girls will get your number from somewhere and start conversations.

These are just my experiences though.",21,2025-08-10 08:24:05,False,What's it like being handsome?,563,2025-08-10 03:43:42,392,,,,,,[]

But when a man is in love, he only sees his woman. Once a person falls in love, they start putting up blinders to everyone else around them. They stop comparing. They are into each other. Look around, and you will see this behavior.  But once the relationship starts having problems, then the couple will again start noticing that there are plenty of fish in the sea. They begin to see beyond the blinders. They see the other options because they are no longer truly in love anymore.  But when two people are truly in love, they block out others. They live in their own world of bliss. A handsome man is only a threat if your woman is not truly in love with you anymore. Being handsome is amazing, for sure.

Even tho I have heard some CRAZY things come out of people’s mouth(like a mother dead ass telling me she wanted her freshly 19 year old daughter to marry me).

To answer your question, on paper yes, it is very easy to get women and oftentimes they approach me. However, keeping them is also another game.

Not having anyone has always been at the bottom of my “I need to worry about this” list. I get looked at, approached, asked out, etc etc. But you also have to be VERY careful with women as well. Especially with the attention they give you. It’s easy to fall in a trap of having too much of something. You also have to deal with the shallow aspect of it with women who really only want to sleep with you. 


To put it in perspective, I have never been turned down and I have had women ask me out more than I have asked them out, They have approached me more than I have approached them, All of the actual relationships came from women who approached me outside of one.

This also is kind of a feedback loop. Because you have better experiences with people, you tend to have a better outlook on people, you have more social/life experiences, and so on.

With that said, if your personality/social skills **really** suck, this won't benefit you much further than the initial interaction. It's not a *total* cheat code, you still have to have at least something to work with in that sense. (you can get pretty far being hot + mediocre otherwise, you just can't be *awful*).

n7xqtz3,1mmfdfw,AskMen,DevilishRogue,"The best thing about being handsome so far as the opposite sex are concerned is the default position for them tends towards you being deemed a potential person to have sex with. This makes it an awful lot easier to achieve than if you are starting from a default position of not being a potential person to have sex with and having to overcome that hurdle first.

In other words, it removes a hurdle that most guys face - in effect making things easier, yes. The problem is that for many attractive guys, that creates a level of satisfaction which never needs to be improved upon for personal happiness so they don't possess the personality (or particularly when young, the desire) to maintain a relationship. It's easier to just move on to the next option and enjoy a new honeymoon phase until your faults are no longer overlooked.

But, no, women don't throw themselves at you (although some do overstep boundaries that would see them calling the police if the sexes were reversed) and other girls and their boyfriends tend to be fine providing you don't act like a dick.",3,2025-08-10 06:25:59,False,What's it like being handsome?,563,2025-08-10 03:43:42,392,,,,,,[]

What I'm handsome enough for is always getting a girl interested in me I'm when I'm going out to social gatherings, birthday parties.

I just went to one like two days ago and some girl that I didn't talk to all night added me on Instagram and my friend is trying to set up a double date even though um reluctant.

My looks improved a lot after I got older so I know what difference it makes. Another thing is that people just remember you more. I was a very forgettable dude, now people always remember my name and the conversations I have with them. Some random girls say they know me from X place even though I've never even noticed them.

In general strangers are friendlier, maybe a smile in the grocery store instead of ignoring you altogether, a follow up question from the person ringing up your coffee. People just care a little more but I do mean only a little.

Dating - it gets your foot in the door but after that it's not a huge difference. You get a lot more opportunities/matches/dates but all the same hassles of dating applies, ghosting, having to carry a conversation, etc. I can't speak to hook up culture but that's been my experience.

And the final disclaimer is it's easy to attribute this to being better looking but I'd say it's 50/50 between being more externally handsome/attractive vs the boost to self-esteem/confidence I got as a result of it making me more internally attractive.

I’ve seen his DMs and I see how people treat him. Yeah he gets a lot of girls, he gets the IG models and all the girls other guys wish they could pull but often times the hot girls intentions are shallow and superficial. They see him as a hot body and nothing more. They never truly valued him for the depth of his soul, for his intelligence, or for his kindness. They just wanted the hot basketball guy with the social media following. 

Early on when I met him I told him I don’t like how girls just see his attractive body and disregard everything else about him. 

Likewise his close friends told him to not date me and date the other girl instead bc she was physically attractive and more aligned with his gym rat lifestyle as opposed to me the plus size nerdy weird girl lol. His female friend actually said I should be embarrassed for even thinking I had a chance with him. He felt like he had to hide his feelings for me and go for the IG model simply bc that’s what his friends and society told him he needed to do for his status and whatnot. But his heart and soul said otherwise. He knew what we had was a real genuine connection and every other hot girl he dated was just exhausting and not aligned with his higher purpose. 

He said the girls were often times insecure, entitled, and toxic af. And at the end of the day he realized those shallow connections were just him being lustful and attempting to people please. He said he’s tired of it, he’s tired of the same old crap in these shitty superficial connections. So he put his ego aside shut down all the opposing voices and choose me over the IG model he was talking to. 

Now we get weird but curious looks everywhere we go lol people wonder what I did to pull him. People assume he’s just using me. People assume a lot of things tbh. I’m getting stalked and harassed by these girls now. They call me a fat ugly ogre and shit just to break my confidence. He feels bad that I’m going through this bs bc of him, and he feels bad that these girls are taking shots at me without even knowing a damn thing about me.

It's hard to just like...blend in anywhere. Especially if you're somewhat tall (~6 foot and up, so you don't really have to be *tall*, just slightly taller than average height), people will stare and look at you even when you're trying to chill in the background of anything

You get offered, or at least people make it clear you could, take a lot of surface level relationships or quick nights of fun. 

Searching for something real is paradoxically not made much easier by this; you end up in a weird place where other attractive people who are actually quite basic gravitate towards you. If you're a nerd who grew up not attractive and grew into your looks, it creates a weird dynamic where Chad and Stacies kinda think you're one of them when you're really not. I've talked about my interests to people and when they deviate from how they've type cast you in their head, laughter ensues as they try to reconcile that mental type casting with the actual reality of you",1,2025-08-10 09:25:06,False,What's it like being handsome?,563,2025-08-10 03:43:42,392,,,,,,[]

n7yw1ao,1mmfdfw,AskMen,EPalmighty,"I have an…interesting perspective. I work maintenance at a retirement/memory home. There’s like 4 guys that work here and everyone else are women. Im pretty attractive with red hair (old ladies LOVE red hair) plus I have a fun, casual personality. I get a lot of attention and it can overwhelming accepting compliments. The residents openly flirt and will say some pretty risqué things, which I just have to endure and laugh off. The housekeepers and care partners flirt openly too, but I’m not really  attracted to anyone here. I kind of flirt/tease back with no intentions of anything happening.

It can be a lot, though. Everyone wants my attention. You gotta people please here so I give the residents my attention whenever they want it. Plus memory care doesn’t give a fuck about what they say or do and handling that is weird. They stare and get really close and want hugs and stuff, but you never know if they just ate their shit or not. It’s a bit of a catch 22.

Its easier to interact with women, they are more willing to as well, but you still need confidence and also the means to date. Working on both those now.

Despite being handsome I had no self confidence until recent years and didn't really realize I was conventionally attractive until one girlfriend taught me how to dress to impress.

Now I have found someone I consider my life partner, and all her friends fawn over me which is fun and a confidence booster, nothing more would ever come of these sorts of interactions, but it is fun.

I have found that dating hot women is actually not as fun as it seems, my current partner is just a cool person to hang out with, yes she's pretty but she's not a super model.

Like yes sex with hot women is great. But hanging out with someone you actually enjoy the company of is invaluable.

The easier it is to get a woman the easier it is to lose her .

Women are receptive and likely to engage with men they find attractive, but that doesn’t mean they (essentially) throw themselves towards hot men. It’s a subtle thing that I can’t describe in this redddit comment but no, not in my opinion.

This is honestly the best part (imo). Interacting with another man’s *girl* is a night and day comparison to a single woman.

n8acxva,1mmfdfw,AskMen,lightning_twice,"Handsome? Sure, but let’s be real: “handsome” is mostly marketing. 

The version you see in ads and movies is a narrow, curated ideal because it’s easy to sell, not because it’s the universal truth. 

Men often value youth and beauty (symmetry, fitness, certain shapes) because those signal fertility; women tend to value strength, resources, emotional maturity and social standing because they imply safety, stability, and needs being met. (In fact, and in my experience, women tend to find these attributes even *more* ""sexy"" than mere physical beauty -- which changes and diminishes and has actually been presented to me as a red flag... some of the answers I've come across do a good job of illustrating why.)

But real attraction is messier -- shaped by chemistry, timing, quirks, and lived experience. Having the traits Western culture sells as “ideal” might make people more open to you, but it doesn’t mean women will line up for casual sex or abandon their relationships for it. I know plenty of women whose type is big, round, hairy, and funny 😄 -- proof that everyone is someone’s type, and the real world is far bigger than the billboard version of “handsome.”

n804fp3,1mmfdfw,AskMen,G4M35,"It's a very long story, I can try to summarize it here.

I reached bottom. A few times too many, each time separated by a few years; then again there was ""that"" latest time...

I promised to myself that:

1. I was going to get myself into therapy within 1 month
2. Thats this time therapy was going to be different, instead of relying on the therapist to do therapy **to** me, I was going to become the best patient ever, and take accountability and responsibility for the outcomes of my therapy.

4. I realized I was constantly playing the victim:
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victim_mentality
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_the_victim
3. I took responsibility and accountability for my depression/anxiety, my present state, and my future state. It was all on me.
3. I made a list of what I was looking for in a therapist. I contacted 5 therapists and none got back to me. LOL.  I contacted about 15 more therapists about 3 or 4 got back to me. I contacted through the web site psychology today, so I got the free consultation. I had my interview questions ready and of all the therapist, 1 made the cut who checked all of my boxes except for one: I was looking for a man, but she was a woman. I picked her, best decision ever.
4. I asked her to give me a time slot, same day of the week, same time.
5. I made it clear to myself and to her, that I was going to show up no matter what, rain or shine.
6. I arrived to each session prepared with an agenda about what I wanted to talk about, but also left her roo to do her thing too. At the end of each session I asked her to give me ""homework"", stuff to do during the week between sessions.
7. I read/study all I could get my hands on about depression/anxiety, but only science or science-based stuff. No crappy new age self help shit!  The best book is *Feeling good*.
8. I did a lot more work, most of it under the supervision of the therapist. One of the things I did was journaling the way that the book *Feeling good* outlines. I journaled multiple times a day.
9. I took a part-time job just for the purpose of paying for therapy. I considered this part of the therapy.
10. I guess I got lucky too.
11. After a year or so I was diagnosed as depression-free. I continued to my therapy for an additional 6 months or so.
12. After therapy I continued to work on myself.

Today this is my mantra: the quality of my life is the summation of the outcomes of the decisions I make, the actions I take, and my reactions/responses to life's events.  It's all on me.

And also:

1. I am not important
2. I am not a snowflake nor a unicorn
3. The world owes me nothing
4. Nobody owes me anything
5. I need to work hard AF to achieve anything, and I will get back ~90% of the effort that I put in (life's not fair)

Thanks for proving my point :P 

And yes, lifestyle and status does play a role for sure. But looks will get your foot in the door and will generate genuine attraction. 

But, the fact of the matter is...if you took two individuals who made the same 6 figure income and had the same lifestyle; one was a 5'6, balding dude who's overweight or has a beer gut - and the other 6'0, in average to good shape, average to good face and a hair full of head...the former is NEVER going to get the same level of attraction from women as the latter. That just isn't how it works. The 5'6 guy may have women interested in him because of his money or his status...but one could argue that that isn't really true physical attraction, because it isn't his looks that got him in the door.

But if you lack other things you can’t get by on looks alone. If a good looking guy is needy, or has an attitude like he’s worthless he is REPULSIVE to girls. 

The issue with this conversation is we as guys tend to think that girls use the same rating criteria we use for them, and vice versa. We think improving looks is what they want, and girls think that them being an entrepreneur and having high status is what makes them attractive to us. We don’t care we just want a hot girl who’s nice. And that’s what clueless guys think women want, a hot guy that’s nice. Get me? 

Even in your scenario you say the girl will only love him for his money , is that true for his looks too? As men we are NEVER “loved” the same way women are. Men want Barbie, women want everything that comes with Ken. 

That LOVE she has is your ABILITY to make her FEEL something and CHASE you. It doesn’t need to come from looks. 

By the way dude it’s hard out here for a good looking guy too. I get called handsome a lot… but i probably get turned down just as much as a less attractive guy for cold approaches. That hardly ever works. 

What works best is being in some sort of social circle and being respected within that. Women pick up on that and it’s these things that actually matter to them

n895t6a,1mmfdfw,AskMen,Qu3stion_R3ality1750,"> But if you lack other things you can’t get by on looks alone

You absolutely can, though. Are you aware of [hobosexuals?](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Hobosexual)

Do you think these individuals won their partners over with their huge bank account? or their ambitions? 

> If a good looking guy is needy, or has an attitude like he’s worthless he is REPULSIVE to girls.

Also false. There are plenty of handsome genuinely conventionally attractive men who have significant personality disorders... like extreme neediness/abandonment issues/etc...but they do just fine with women. 

> The issue with this conversation is we as guys tend to think that girls use the same rating criteria we use for them, and vice versa.

No, we use the fact that they're human beings who are visual creatures...just like their male counterparts.

The halo effect is real. People like good looking people, this isn't just a woman thing. It's a human thing. 

Even if women are *less* visual than men regarding attraction, acting like it doesn't also play a humongous role is cope and lies. 

> We think improving looks is what they want

because they do, they absolutely do...and there isn't anything wrong with that, but just don't bullshit about it and pretend it isn't so

> girls think that them being an entrepreneur and having high status is what makes them attractive to us

*SOME* women think that. I think the majority of women that have even a modicum of awareness of what men want know that majority of us don't really give that much of a fuck about a woman making a high income or being a well-connected socialite. 

> We don’t care we just want a hot girl who’s nice.

And majority of women know that, or at least are vaguely aware. 

> Even in your scenario you say the girl will only love him for his money , is that true for his looks too?

What the fuck are you on about? No, this woman is *NOT* going to love the 5'6, balding guy for his looks. Quit playing...

In the scenario I laid out, most women would choose the 6'0 guy with the full head of hair with everything else being equal. 

> As men we are NEVER “loved” the same way women are.''

Elaborate??

> That LOVE she has is your ABILITY to make her FEEL something and CHASE you

Majority of women will not *""chase""* after men unless they are *REALLY* attracted to him...and most women are decidedly not attracted to most men; we know that fact. 

So this is an entirely useless, moot point at best

> It doesn’t need to come from looks.

Looks is what gets your foot in the door. If you're unappealing to a lot of women for whatever reason, then it doesn't matter what sort of amazing personality traits you have. 

If you don't get invited to even interview for the position, you can be the best IT helpdesk person on the planet and it won't matter. 

> By the way dude it’s hard out here for a good looking guy too

Ehhh, for different reasons. 

> but i probably get turned down just as much as a less attractive guy for cold approaches

I bet you that you don't 

> That hardly ever works

That's one thing we agree on

> What works best is being in some sort of social circle and being respected within that

Sure, that definitely plays a role. But if you're 5'5 and balding, you can be well-liked and well-respected and still have zero women looking to go to bed with and/or date you. It happens...

> So being good looking is easier? Yes.

Two things we agree on

> Doomed? Not at all

Debatable, depends on the person

> I’m not tall but I don’t think I’m doomed

How tall are you? Also, if you have a nice face and a fit body that can help mitigate the height thing to a certain extent. 

> Work with what you got , play the hand you’re dealt and own it / love yourself and play the numbers game while you improve in every other way.

n88qicm,1mo0iyp,AskMen,AutoModerator,"Here's an original copy of /u/Please_makeit_stop's post (if available):

Something I’ve noticed, and honestly find kind of sad…is how many straight men seem to hold back during sex. Not in terms of performance, but in terms of feeling it. Like, really letting go.

I’ve heard guys say they suppress their sounds, their facial expressions, even their physical reactions at the peak of orgasm because they’re afraid of how it might look. Too feminine. Too emotional. Too vulnerable. And I can’t help but wonder where those expectations even came from.

Because as a gay man, the exact things I’ve heard straight guys describe as things to avoid: the moans, the loss of control, the rawness of it, are the things we often celebrate. That’s the moment we want to see. That full-body surrender. That look in someone’s eyes when they stop performing and start feeling.

So I’m curious how other men see this. Have you ever found yourself holding back in those moments, not because you wanted to, but because of some idea of how you’re supposed to look or sound? Do you think it’s about masculinity, image, control, or something else entirely?

I’d genuinely love to hear from men who have thought about this. Where did your idea of masculinity even come from in the first place?

n88szc4,1mo0iyp,AskMen,RobinGood94,"Depends.

I have no issue moaning and almost whimpering with someone I love. It’s usually because she’s doing things that she knows absolutely melt me. She’s toying with me, pleasing me just as I long to please her. I welcome the act of laying on my back and giving her full control as she rides to her own rhythm, or lays on me and thrusts on me etc. 

Where I am not comfortable letting loose is when I am asked to do aggressive things to help them climax or fit some sort of desire. I know how strong I am. I know how much weaker you are. I am not comfortable rewiring my brain to find some sort of sexual pleasure from harming you, even if you like it. That is a monster that cannot ever be tamed. I have no idea how some do it, but it’s scary to me. The idea of slapping you around, choking you, etc. I just can’t. I know my mind. I know how lost it could get while being incredibly violent. I know how I used to have anger issues as a kid. I remember how hard I worked and trained to fix that. There are many times when I am enjoying a moment and it’s too intense for them without even having a violent component to it. I cannot imagine being in a sexual rage. Hats off to the gents who can safely do this and put that dark energy away.

That just simply cannot be unlocked or developed. It’s a twisted fantasy that a few have asked of me. When I think of how potent that kind of sexual activity could be, I know how I’d long for it.

n88x67v,1mo0iyp,AskMen,SadSickSoul,"My very weird answer about how my perception of masculinity has affected the way I experience sex is that my perception of masculinity is why I have eschewed sex, because I got fucked up early on and internalized a lot of really, really harmful shit.

My idea of masculinity was mostly formed by my dad, who was a hard working, hard drinking, man's man and lady's man who held every manly job you can think of and was just that guy who oozed manliness. He was also an abusive drunk, an incorrigible flirt and a womanizer, and seeing him chase skirts and say shit like ""just because I'm chained to the porch doesn't mean I can't bark at the cars"" and shit like that, combined with the nascent popular understanding of just how prevalent creeps, predators and exploiters hurt women through sexual harassment and assault, really taught preteen me that male sexuality is inherently unhealthy and violent, and I hated everything about it. And then I went through puberty and developed a sex drive. It was fucking awful, and to this day I have severe damage about it. That, plus body issues and my own insecurities, have led me to react to the idea of sex with incredible amounts of fear, disgust and self-loathing. It's not fun. I wish I could just snip it out of my head and just be asexual. That'd be nice.

Anyways, there's your unnecessarily trauma-dumpy, somewhat tangential answer to the question you asked.

n8ahsi9,1mo0iyp,AskMen,Maleficent_Ad3944,"Thank you. I try to be honest with myself at least if nobody else. 


It is brutal, but life is brutal sometimes. Life doesn't seem to care about what we want. The majority of my life is being unseen, at least until I'm gone, then my absence gets noticed. I'm pretty much used to it.


Also, I know I'm not alone. There are plenty of men out there that go through the same thing or feel they do. That offers little comfort though. Because I am alone. We're all in the same situation, but all alone sometimes. It's loke someone handing you a soda so you can rehydrate after a hangover when what you really need is an IV. It's a bad analogy, but best I can come up with right now. 


I've got some great friends and family. Truly incredible that I appreciate more than words or actions can say. People that would take a bullet for me. But that doesn't change the feeling that I'm undesirable that even around them, I can feel alone.nIt doesn't change the fact that I haven't had a date in almost 11 years, or that even before that my dating pool looked like the Sahara. Plenty of friends and acquaintances saying I'd be a great catch. Lots of girls saying they'd want a boyfriend who treated them more like I do, even trying to set me up with friends of theirs. Some of which also became friends, but expressed a similar disinterest in romance. 


I've had 40 years to adjust to that. It's normal now. No different than the lack of outward expression people have for me in general. People don't get excited to see me like they do others, they don't get angry or disappointed when things come up and I can't make it to a planned event. That isn't to say they don't appreciate me, but that it happens on a deeper level, one they can't always express, one that doesn't cause them to jump for joy or breakdown crying.

It was a performance I had to either survive or fail at. Growing up, “masculinity” wasn’t about genetics, it was a weapon used to punish softness, emotion, queerness. It dictated how I was allowed to exist in the world, especially in my own body. So yeah, it absolutely affected how I show up sexually. I had to unlearn years of shame just to feel safe moaning, surrendering, or even letting myself feel good without fear of judgment.

You’re right. Knowing you’re not alone doesn’t always help. Because the loneliness you’re describing isn’t just about being single. It’s about that quiet ache of going unseen. Being valued in the abstract, but never wanted in the flesh. Being appreciated for who you are, but never craved. Never hungered for. And it’s that hunger, that deep, wordless desire, that so many of us have lived our lives without ever truly tasting.

I don’t think there’s anything wrong with you, man. I think the problem is the world doesn’t know what to do with a man like you. Someone who doesn’t hide behind bravado. Someone who gives without expecting. Someone who sees people deeper than they know how to return. That kind of heart. That kind of depth. It scares the shallow. It overwhelms the ones still trapped in their own surface-level bullshit.

But I see you. Your story matters. The way you feel matters. And I hope, fuck, I pray, that someday someone meets you with the same intensity and desire you’ve carried quietly for everyone else. Because you deserve more than quiet admiration. You deserve to be desired out loud.

The reason I brought up masculinity is because so many men say “that’s just how I am” without questioning why they are that way. You might genuinely be wired quieter, and that’s totally valid. But when a man says, “I only make noise when she asks me to,” and otherwise stays silent even when overwhelmed by pleasure, that sounds more like a habit built around control than an instinct built around sensation.

Masculinity teaches a lot of us to filter, to minimize, to stay composed. So when a guy says he doesn’t make sound~even alone~it makes me wonder whether it’s because he doesn’t feel the need, or because he’s spent his whole life learning how to not feel out loud. Those aren’t the same thing.

Since your post was asking about other peoples experience with masculinity, yes. If I want to compare other ideas around masculinity to mine, I have to mention mine and explain the difference. But also yes, I could have asked you better/clearer about your current stance - we agree on that.

>You don’t get to tell me what masculinity should be

100% agreed, which is why I never did. What I did was share my opinion about other definition of the term, my understanding of the term and you are free to disagree. I'm not your masculinity guru nor would I want to be. I'd be delighted to see you in the future be very much unbothered by anyone yapping anything about masculinity that you deem unproductive, irrelevant or harmful for your life quality - including mine.

>All I was doing here was asking guys a question not trying to get into an argument or discussion about my take or experience with masculinity.

Fair: I don't think my understanding of masculinity affects my sexual life at all as I deem the term a description of a side phenomenon of a much broader existence we have as humans.

I'm 25M, 1.75m tall and weigh about 58kg. I've noticed that a lot of my colleagues at office and friends (especially those who’ve been working a few years longer than me in desk jobs) seem to have put on noticeable weight. Many are a bit “rounded” now and even with a belly, if I can put it that way. Not necessarily obese, just visibly heavier and chubby with a belly.

Personally, I am a bit miffed about being skinny. I want to gain around 8–10kg. I’ve always had a fast metabolism, and no matter what I eat, I seem to stay slim. Funny thing is, I brought this up to a senior friend of mine (who is definitely on the overweight side with a big belly) while we were out eating. I asked how he gained so much weight since college when he was in shape. He laughed, patted my face and shoved a cheese burger in my mouth and said ""Eat three of those every night, drink a big fat glass of milk, sleep well and long hours, and stop playing tennis!”  
He was half-joking, but also kind of serious. I’m starting to think I need to approach this more intentionally, but I’d really appreciate advice from older guys who’ve been through this stage already.

Most people I know who are skinny and say they have a fast metabolism or can’t gain weight really just don’t eat. Odds are your idea of being full and most are not the same.

Your stomach stretches. When you eat till you’re full that’s your limit. But if you eat past that you will stretch your stomach out. Doing that enough will make you eat more as you won’t feel full.

When I’m on a cut after lifting for months and eating a lot my stomach shrinks. When I eat what I normally would I feel full. Once I eat more and more soon enough I’m eating the same and then full. 

As fucked as it sounds you kinda have to eat past being full, not to a point of barfing but slowly expand your stomach. 

Try to eat throughout the day and slowly expand your stomach and try not to eat one big meal as your perception of calories is skewed.

Just be careful if you go too far in the sauce you will get fat and it’s hard to remove your brain’s chemical response to lose weight than to gain.

Also, in the unlikely event of a fist fight, fat...doesn't help much if at all. It allows your blows to impact with more force, but it slows them down, and it really drains your endurance and stamina. Overall if you have more muscle than the other guy you're probably going to win even if he weighs a lot more in fat. (Technique is important too, but impossible for somebody who is so fat they get winded from moving their body around.)

It terms of health, lean is better than large.

For men, the ideal body fat % seems to be about 10%. Unless you're anorexic, you're probably not lower than that.

So I'd say focus on strength training, eat protein when hungry, and let the results happen. Focus on exercise rather than diet.

Exercise matters. Diet matters more. It's basic thermodynamics. If you consume more calories than you burn, you will gain weight. If you burn more than you consume, you will lose weight. If you think you're eating a lot and you're not gaining weight, you're not eating enough.

Use the revised Harris-Benedict Equation to calculate your daily caloric burn, and then just consume more to maintain bulking.

You need to find out how much protein you need, and you need to make sure you reach it. And even more than that is you need to start lifting weights. You don’t have to lift heavy in the beginning, you don’t even have to go to a gym if you don’t want to. Go buy some adjustable dumbbells, go online and find a workout plan. I’m telling you as long as you got enough protein and disciplined enough to work out you will absolutely gain muscle. I am literally walking proof of it.

Three years ago, I was 5 feet 7 135lbs and basically took five years off working out. I made up my mind that I was tired of being skinny, I was tired of looking the way I was looking. All my fat was in my belly, and I could literally touch my fingers around my bicep with one hand.

My first year I put on 20 lbs of muscle,  I put on 10 pounds last year, and currently I’m out of around 8 pounds this year so far. I’ve even lost 25lbs of fat  the past three years.  

I work out at least five days a week, I make sure no matter what I get at least 80 g of protein a day, if not more when I have the opportunity, I got rid of my Mountain Dew and Pepsi for sugar free drinks, and I made sure to get my hormone levels checked to make sure my testosterone is operating effectively. 

You can completely change what you look like.  I mean it. And eventually, if you stay disciplined enough with your workouts, it’s not even that hard to do it anymore for me.

This tends to build muscle without hypertrophy, therefore the muscle gain will not be as visible but still provides the foundation for a toned body.

>Eat as much protein as you can. Real protein. Shakes and bars as supplements only.

Estrogen encourages the body to increase fat retention. High protein diet means less carbs which means less bloat for a toned body and it encourages ketogenesis.

When I’m genuinely attracted to a woman, all my insecurities kind of disappear.  My brain function does too. It honestly feels scary. Vulnerable. I’ll look in her eyes and go blank while she’s speaking. Not even thinking about anything sexual. I notice things like how she smells when she hugs or walks past me. I’m less worried about being funny or smart and more about making her laugh or helping her with something. I’ll just call her on the phone. Not even worried about looking obsessive or “like I like her” when I was younger.

There are multiple men in this thread mad at my question, going as far to claim I’m sexist, meanwhile others say the sexual attraction is very different to being in love. I didn’t mean to ask it in an offensive way. Women are sexually attracted to men’s height, scent etc., and have a craving to be ‘secure’ - all quite superficial things albeit whereas men can just like what they see. My claim was never that men are fucking cavemen, people are so sensitive 😭

This feeling of seems to come when they actually start having feelings for a girl.

n8axxul,1mo2uhd,AskMen,PhraseSeveral1302,"I think that's true.  It's possible for me to think a woman is sexy and wonder what she's like, but know that she's not ""my type"" and that I likely wouldn't get along well with her.  The romantic attraction, as some others have said, means I not only want to be around her but the provider/protector in me starts to manifest.  I \*want\* to buy her stuff she likes for the pleasure of seeing her happy, not because I want to get into her pants.  So it's a different mindset.  At that point physical attributes become secondary.

I've been married 36 years and I can tell you that I was really never \*only\* sexually attracted to my wife.  She got me with her eyes and her intelligence, and the way she carried herself with confidence.  The romance emerged \*long\* before the sexual attraction.
