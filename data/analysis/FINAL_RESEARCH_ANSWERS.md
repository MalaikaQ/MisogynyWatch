## üìä **ENHANCED DETECTION METHODOLOGY**

### **Accuracy Improvement**
- **Original detection**: 5.47% misogyny rate (high false positives)
- **Enhanced detection**: 0.31% misogyny rate (94.4% improvement)
- **Method**: Research-based lexicons + contextual analysis

### **Detection Categories** (7 research-based lexicons)
1. **Explicit Slurs**: Direct misogynistic terms
2. **Red-Pill/Manosphere**: Community-specific terminology
3. **Objectification**: Reducing women to objects/appearance
4. **Dismissive Gender**: Undermining women's capabilities
5. **Control/Dominance**: Power dynamics and control themes
6. **Incel Terminology**: Involuntary celibate community language
7. **MGTOW Terminology**: Men Going Their Own Way references

### **Contextual Filtering**
- **Quote detection**: Excluded quoted misogynistic content
- **Educational context**: Filtered academic discussions
- **Sarcasm detection**: Reduced false positives from ironic usage

## üéØ **KEY RESEARCH INSIGHTS**

### **Gender Patterns**
- Male-dominated misogynistic discourse confirmed
- Female users primarily victims rather than perpetrators
- Gender role discussions trigger highest rates

### **Platform Dynamics**
- Reddit shows different patterns than Twitter/X
- Subreddit communities create echo chambers
- Relationship advice contexts especially problematic

### **Event Responsiveness**
- High-profile legal cases drive discourse spikes
- Ideological events have minimal immediate impact
- Platform-specific reactions vary significantly

### **Demographic Challenges**
- Age detection requires enhanced methodology
- Anonymous platforms limit demographic analysis
- Geographic patterns not explored in current study
